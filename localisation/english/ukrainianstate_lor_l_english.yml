 ukr_lor.800.d:0 "The Ukrainian state of Pavlo Skoropadskyi fell in reality at the end of 1918 after the antigetman uprising of the UPR supporters. But what would have happened if the hetman had not changed the course towards rapprochement with the conservative and pro-Russian forces in November 1918, but continued the struggle for the independence of the Ukrainian people and consolidated the nation during the war of independence? \n \nSigning an agreement with the Directorate on the joint struggle for a united and free Ukraine, Skoropadskyi managed to keep the previously built state structure and army of the Ukrainian state. Ukrainian troops began a heavy war at the same time against the Red and White, and later, helping WUPR, and against the Poles. On January 22, 1919, the Ukrainian state and the WUPR signed an act of unification into a united state. However, the impossibility of a war on three fronts, without any foreign support, forced Skoropadskyi to go in the spring of 1919 for a temporary truce with Poland and give him control over Galicia and Volyn. \n \nHaving gained the recognition of Poland as an equal ally in the war against the Bolsheviks, the Ukrainian state managed to establish relations with the Entente interventionists and temper the white ambitions that occupied the Donbass and the Black Sea region. Further failures of the White Guards and their retreat to the south of the Bolsheviks allowed by the spring of 1920 almost without a fight to return these territories with the tacit consent of the interventionists, displacing white remnants to the Crimea. \n \nThe Red Army began the last major offensive against Ukraine at the end of the summer of 1920. In the Battle of Kharkov, the attackers suffered a heavy defeat and the attack choked. At this time, on the Polish front, the army of the Soviets also developed an unfavorable situation, the Polish troops were already near Minsk. In November 1920, after the defeat of the main forces of the Whites, the Soviet governance agreed to a truce with Poland and the Ukrainian state, realizing that their capture would be very long and difficult for the bloodless long war of Soviet Russia. The World revolution was postponed indefinitely, and the Ukrainian people finally gained their own independent state."

 ukr_lor.801.d:0 "After the end of the war, Skoropadskyi again raised the question of the ownership of Western Ukrainian lands. The Ukrainian position was based on the recommendations of the Entente on the delimitation of these lands on the basis of ethnicity, the alleged border became known later as the “Curzon Line” by the name of the British Foreign Secretary. However, Poland did not want to make concessions in this matter, and France supported them in this, and the Ukrainian State was in too vulnerable a position for a military solution to this issue at that time. This territorial claim was the only official claim of the Skoropadskyi State at the time of 1936 and significantly worsened relations with Poland.\n \nHetman diligently began to strengthen his position in power after the onset of the long-awaited peace. Opposition political figures dismissed from the army and the state apparatus, some opponents of the regime were convicted under various articles and became political prisoners. The activity of any left parties was strictly prohibited. In 1924, the only elections to the State Rada were held under a majoritarian system with conditions favorable to Skoropadskyi and his party organization UNSU. In the future, representatives of individual districts were rarely re-elected to parliament, and during the Hetmanate, it was extremely difficult to get into the ranks of the opposition figure.\n \nReforms of the judiciary and law enforcement system were carried out, as well as administrative reform, dividing the territory of the Ukrainian State into smaller regions compared to previous provinces. Ukrainian hryvnia was used as the national currency. But one of the most painful questions for the people was the land issue, the hetman relied on the support of large landowners and pursued a land policy in their interests, poor peasants often had only to get a job for them.\n \nThe Ukrainian economy after the war began a gradual recovery. The state actively supported large landowners, agricultural exports grew, and metallurgy and light industry also developed well. The world economic crisis of 1929 was a pretty strong blow to the Ukrainian producers, Skoropadskyi had to take unpopular measures to stabilize the economy. The expenditures on the army during this period were also reduced, it began to focus more on the suppression of internal resistance than on repelling the attack of an external enemy." 
 ukr_lor.802.t:0 "Parties and Leaders"
 ukr_lor.802.d:0 "UHS. Initially, Skoropadsky's coming to power was supported by such organizations as the Ukrainian People's Community, the Ukrainian Democratic Grain Party and the Union of Land Owners. After the war, a single conservative Ukrainian union of grain growers-sovereigns was created, which was supposed to put an end to the party freemen and unite the anti-democratic pro-hetman forces into a single ruling party. Subsequently, this party underwent some purges and was transformed into the Union of Hetmans-statesmen, on which the hetman could fully rely in his decisions. \n \nOUN. The former leader of the Sich Riflemen Yevgeny Konovalets after the war was a consistent supporter of Skoropadsky, seeing in him the liberator of the Ukrainian people. From 1924 to 1929 Konovalets was even the first minister of defense of the Ukrainian state. However, the hetman's hesitation in resolving the issue of Western Ukrainian lands led to the gradual transition of Konovalets to the number of supporters of radical nationalists. In 1929, he was removed from office for constant conflicts with the hetman and his ministers, after which Konovalets founded the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which included many revanchist and ultra-right associations. There were several groups in the OUN that gravitated towards different leaders within the party, some sympathized with Nazi Germany, others advocated their own path to the unification of Ukrainian lands, but in 1936 Konovalets still remained the undisputed leader of the movement. \n \nUSDRP. The Ukrainian Social Democratic Labor Party was founded in 1905 and was then an ordinary leftist party in the expanses of the Russian Empire. Many of its leaders played a significant role in the further liberation struggle of 1917-1920. In 1919, the party split into a right-wing majority and a left-wing minority, the leaders of the former included such personalities as Vinnichenko and Petlyura, who supported the Hetmanate only because it was necessary to maintain internal unity during the war. After the war, the party was repeatedly persecuted by the hetman's authorities, Petlyura in 1923 was even sentenced to 11 years in prison under a far-fetched pretext. In 1930, he was released under an amnesty, when the hetman's government tried to soften domestic policy in the face of a growing economic crisis, and quickly became the leader of the united democratic opposition. The USDRP advocates a peaceful struggle for the rights and freedoms of the common people, regular free elections to the Sovereign Rada and the release of all political prisoners. \n \nKPU. Members of the leftist parties in the Ukrainian state were viewed by many as traitors to the motherland and agents of Moscow, and often this was indeed the case. In 1924, the hetman even completely banned any activity on the left political flank. Under these conditions, the Communist Party of Ukraine could only operate underground, and its public leaders had previously fled to Soviet Russia. The leader of the Communist Party, Alexander Shumsky, advocated socialist transformation in Ukraine and peaceful cooperation with the Moscow Bolsheviks as an equal ally, rather than an autonomous republic within the Soviet Union. Even if we admit his sincerity, Stalin's plans could turn out to be completely different in this regard ..."

 ukr_lor.803.d:0 "THE USSR. Under the ceasefire of 1920 and the subsequent border treaty of 1922, practically all ethnic Ukrainian lands, previously claimed by various Soviet puppet formations like the Ukrainian SSR or the DKSR, came under the hetman's authority. The Bolsheviks thus lose their official claims to the Ukrainian territory, however, on the way to the return of the territories of the former Tsarist Russia, the Ukrainian issue will still be one of the priorities, which is understood by both sides. Moscow is haunted by the fact that the numerous East Slavic people, which could be relatively easily assimilated into a single state, are on the side of the bourgeois European states, in some way even being an ideological and strategic base for attacking the country of the Soviets. Relations between the two states are cold, the hetman's security forces actively persecute any left-wing and simply Muscovite activists, the Soviet government, for its part, keeps any national organizations of Ukrainians living on Soviet territory under strict control. \n \nPoland. Relations with the Polish state are also very difficult. Ukraine claims the territory of Galicia and Volhynia with a predominant total share of the Ukrainian population. During the joint war of independence against the Bolsheviks, this issue was postponed for some time, but then it gradually came to the fore again. After the war, many military and political figures from the western lands remained in the Ukrainian state, who constantly fuel anti-Polish sentiments. Poland, for its part, pursues a discriminatory policy towards the Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities, which responds with active subversive activities. The Ukrainian underground in the west maintains active ties with the OUN, and it is the nationalists who are most determined to return these territories, even at the cost of a bloody war. \n \nRomania. Of all the land neighbors, only Romania has relatively good relations, but they can remain at this level only as long as the Hetmanate does not officially put forward claims to part of Bukovina and Bessarabia. And there are quite a lot of supporters of the idea to move the Romanian border in various political parties, especially in the OUN. These potentially disputed territories went to Romania after the war, and there are quite a few ethnic Ukrainians living in Northern Bukovina and parts of Bessarabia.." 
 ukr_lor.804.t:0 "Foreign policy, part 2"
 ukr_lor.804.d:0 "Former Entente. Relations with Great Britain and France were initially difficult. The interventionists during the civil war eventually tended to recognize the Ukrainian state as an ally in the fight against the Bolsheviks, but they wanted to see it in a federation with the state formations of the White movement, which the whites themselves saw as the entry of Ukraine into a united Russia on the rights of autonomy. After the defeat of the army of the South of Russia, no one seriously considered these plans. Western democracies preferred to establish relations with the Hetman's government, forming a cordon sanitaire on the western border of Soviet Russia, while no real assistance was provided to Ukraine either during the war or after it. \n \nWhite Crimea. The Wrangel government was ready to recognize the Ukrainian state, but only as one of the participants in the anti-Bolshevik bloc under its governance. The White Guards were willing to fight alongside the Ukrainians against the Reds as long as they were weak and needed protection in the north from invasion, but in the event of the fall of the Bolshevik regime, most of the former tsarist officers saw Ukraine only as an integral part of the new united Russia. Many of them harbored a grudge against Skoropadsky, who during the war either promised to agree to all the conditions of Denikin and Wrangel for the sake of defeating a common enemy, or at the most inconvenient moment stepped up the offensive against the Whites and forced them out of the Black Sea region. \n \nGermany. Imperial Germany and the Ukrainian state fought on the same side during the Great War. Skoropadsky held on to power and after the war also felt sympathy for Germany, which was forced to sign the humiliating Treaty of Versailles and also wanted to change some of the conditions of the post-war world system. Active military and economic cooperation was established with the Weimar Republic, joint developments were carried out in the field of aviation and armored vehicles, which for Germany itself were limited by peace conditions. The German Mauser 98 rifle was also licensed and put into mass production in Ukraine, and several old UB III submarines were purchased for the fleet. With the coming to power of the Nazis, relations between the countries cooled somewhat, Skoropadsky feared that Ukraine could become an object of the Reich's territorial expansion in the future. In 1936, the Germans for the power of Skoropadkoy were a more distant and not as obvious threat as the Russian Bolsheviks, he did not rule out that in the future Nazi Germany would become the only influential ally of Ukraine in the event of an invasion by the Red Army." 
 ukr_lor.805.t:0 "White Crimea"
 ukr_lor.805.d:0 "After the actual defeat in the civil war in 1920, the remnants of the armed forces of the South of Russia retreated to the Crimea, where they were able to securely strengthen themselves due to the geographical position of the peninsula. The northern Black Sea region was occupied by Ukrainian troops, which in places knocked out units of the Red Army, and in places - the disorganized remnants of the White Army, which did not have time to evacuate. Thus, by the end of 1920, the "Reds" and "Whites" were separated by the Kerch Strait, which the former could not overcome due to enemy superiority at sea, and the latter no longer had enough strength to continue the military campaign on the mainland. Crimea found itself in the position of a besieged fortress, the last stronghold of the White movement, while its leaders still claimed all the territories of the deceased Russian Empire and were not going to conclude a peace treaty either with the Bolsheviks or with the Ukrainian hetman.\n \nOfficially, the state was not called, of course, White Crimea. It was controlled by the government of the South of Russia under Commander-in-Chief Pyotr Wrangel, a little later the National Assembly of the South of Russia was formed, while what kind of Russia was meant here - it was decided to postpone this issue until the liberation of all Russian lands, but this Russia definitely should not have become communist by unanimous opinion of white military leaders. Wrangel could only hope for the support of the Entente countries, which recognized his government and provided material assistance to his besieged army. However, after the failure of the intervention, he could no longer hope for direct military intervention. In the future, the Great Depression forced Western countries to take care of their internal affairs, interest in the remnants of the Whites faded over time, and the gradual strengthening of the Soviet state did not allow counting on the rapid fall of the Bolshevik regime.\n \nBy 1936, White Crimea was in a permanent economic and political crisis , became a "gray" unrecognized territory. Former allies continued to provide little support to Wrangel's army, but officially, most countries had already established diplomatic relations with the USSR by this time and did not believe that Crimea could somehow influence the overthrow of the Stalinist regime in the future. Wrangel held power with difficulty, some of his supporters had long since left the Crimea, while others joined the opposition, which sympathized with Nazi Germany as a new anti-Bolshevik force. The indigenous inhabitants of the peninsula, the Crimean Tatars, formed their own opposition body of power - the Mejlis - and advocated granting them broad national autonomy. At the same time, while the Crimean fleet was morally and physically obsolete, the Black Sea Fleet of the USSR was gradually building up its forces. The water ditch of the last stronghold of the White Army will soon cease to be a significant obstacle for the Red Orders..." 
 ukr_lor.806.t:0 "Armed forces of the Ukrainian State"
 ukr_lor.806.d:0 "Land Army. After the end of the War of Independence, the army was only gradually reduced. By 1936, the ground forces consisted of only 11 full-fledged infantry, 3 cavalry and one armored division. Also, 6 divisions of the Serdyuks were gradually formed, playing the role of internal troops, on which Skoropadsky expected to rely in the event of armed uprisings or rebellions in the rest of the army. Thanks to the reduction in numbers, it was possible to ensure good material equipment for most units. The small arms of the infantry were completely updated, the production of domestic armored vehicles, although not the most modern, was launched. The strengths of the Ukrainian army include the presence of a large number of reservists in case of a full-scale war. However, many questions remain about the organization of the army and the quality of officer training, ordinary units are mixed with 'Cossack' units, which the hetman is trying to form from the privileged Cossack class as his main power base.\n \nAviation. Combat aviation of the Ukrainian state played an important role during the war for independence. Subsequently, the production of a replica of the Russian S-22 Ilya Muromets bomber and its own MS BV-1 fighter was launched. At the time of 1936, the Ukrainian Air Force had two fighter squadrons and one bomber squadron.\n \nNavy. The Imperial Black Sea Fleet, which initially came under the control of the Ukrainian state, was later lost due to the advance of the Bolsheviks and foreign intervention, eventually getting to the “whites” in Crimea for the most part. After the war, Skoropadsky paid quite a lot of attention to the restoration of the Ukrainian navy, since important shipbuilding enterprises remained on the territory of Ukraine. At the Nikolaev shipyards in 1927, the Hetman Pyotr Doroshenko cruiser (originally laid down by the Admiral Lazarev) was completed, and in 1932 the new destroyer Chernihiv was launched according to the modernized project of the destroyer of the times of Tsarist Russia of the Lieutenant Pushchin type. In the period from 1929 to 1933, several old submarines of the UB III project were purchased from Germany, four of them were successfully upgraded and accepted into the Ukrainian sovereign fleet. The future flagship of the fleet, the heavy cruiser Philip Orlik, was also laid down, but by 1936 its construction was still far from complete. To protect the coastal garrisons and participate in amphibious assaults, a well-equipped and trained marine brigade was maintained in constant combat readiness."

 ukr_lor.807.d:0 "Transcarpathian Ukraine, Subcarpathian Rus, Ruska Krajina - under such names, from different points of view, the land adjacent to the western side of the Eastern Carpathians, inhabited mainly by Rusyns, was called. Before the Great War, it was part of Austria-Hungary, after which, as a result of a difficult division of the fragments of the empire, it went to the newly formed Czechoslovakia. A separate administrative unit was formed, a region called Subcarpathian Rus, which was initially promised autonomy, but in the end Prague did not give any significant local self-government to its regions.\n \nThe indigenous local population was traditionally called Rusyns, who from the Ukrainian point of view were part of a large people with their regional differences in language and culture. There was a sharp struggle between Russophile and Ukrainophile organizations, and some Russophile leaders drifted towards local Rusyn autonomism under the patronage of Hungary.\n \nThe political situation in Subcarpathian Rus was thus complicated. The Ukrainophiles, led by Avgustin Voloshin, wanted autonomy within the Czechoslovak Republic with a further possibility of joining Ukraine, the Russophiles, represented by the Autonomous Agricultural Union of Andrei Brody and the Ruthenian National Autonomous Party of the Uniate priest Fentsik, which was oriented towards the Italian fascists, supported autonomy within the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic or Hungary , The United Hungarian Party demanded entry into Hungary. By 1936, all these local organizations had not succeeded in achieving autonomy for the province, but clouds had already begun to gather over the Czechoslovak state as a whole."

 ukr_lor.808.d:0 "The revolutionary insurgent army of Ukraine under the governance of Nestor Makhno fought during the years 1918-1921 against almost everyone in the civil war. The Makhnovists, under black anarchist flags, fought for "complete freedom of the working people" against the Austro-German troops, Ukrainian, Volunteer Army, tried to put up with the Red Army, but in the end they were betrayed by the Bolsheviks, because. Makhno's peculiar anarcho-communism had not so many points of contact with the practical implementation of Marxism in the expanses of the late Russian Empire. Like many such insurgent movements in the past, the Makhnovshchina was eventually crushed after the time of weakness among its main enemies passed. The Bolsheviks, after retreating from Yekaterinoslav and Donbass, left the rebel army without supplies and shot many of its representatives, Makhno, with his wife and some of his comrades-in-arms, fled first to Romania, and then to other European countries. The remnants of the Makhnovist troops in the steppe regions of southeastern Ukraine were liquidated by the Hetman's troops in the summer of 1921, some of the leaders and loyal commanders of the anarchist army were captured and received prison terms for robbery and organizing illegal military formations.\n \nNestor Makhno, who was in exile, did not sit folded hands, in 1926 in France, together with Peter Arshinov, he published the Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists. It was an analysis of the basic anarcho-communist principles, a vision for the future of an anarchist society, and recommendations on how an anarchist organization should be structured. This declarative material was met ambiguously in the anarchist community, this direction within the framework of the anarchist movement was called platformism. At the same time, another ally of Makhno, Viktor Belash, got out of prison and tried to legalize veteran organizations of the Makhnovists in the Ukrainian state, while trying not to irritate the Hetmanate too much, while simultaneously publishing his weighty volume with memories of the times of the Makhnovshchina.\n \nNestor Makhno died in Paris in 1934 from bone tuberculosis, without waiting for the practical implementation of all his ideas. His supporters in Ukraine and abroad remain scattered, without a clear program to counter the hetman regime of Skoropadsky. However, times are changing, the previously indestructible system is beginning to crack, and the seeds of anarchy sown in the steppes of Ukraine may one day sprout a bountiful harvest..."
