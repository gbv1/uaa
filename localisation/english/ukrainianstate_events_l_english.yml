The current Moscow government owes its position to the Ukrainian bayonets and clearly agreed with this decision in advance. Interestingly, the double-headed eagle became the coat of arms of Ruthenia, referring to one of the symbols of the Galicia-Volyn principality, the ruler of which also once bore the title of King of Russia. It is also similar to the coat of arms of the Peremyshl land, which further indicates the claims of the young monarchy to all Western Ukrainian lands.

According to information from some media, the Ukrainian army actively participated in this event, which, together with the Crimean accomplices, was able to capture many strategic facilities in Crimea, which made it impossible for the Wrangelites to defend it. Judging by the fact that the newly formed Crimean People's Republic had already agreed to a Ukrainian protectorate, this was indeed the case.

 crimea.1.d:0 "In the rural outback of the Steppe Crimea, the most massive peasant unrest in recent years broke out. Poor farmers are dissatisfied with the fact that the White Army soldiers completely took away many wells and boreholes for their own needs, preventing the local residents from using them. Given the lack of fresh water on the peninsula, this leads to the fact that some peasants do not have enough water even for drinking, not to mention watering moisture-loving seedlings. Now they demand that all sources of water, which our army has not made any effort to provide, be available for general use."

The second group comes out in opposition to the first and says that Kudashev, if not worse, then at least the same 'usurper'. The general vote has already passed and only one deputy of the assembly refrained from voting, and asked to postpone the vote for three days.

In it, he called for "putting aside political differences" and starting "preparations for a new campaign against Red Russia." The speech was perceived rather ambiguously and had almost no effect, but when shots rang out in the hall and armed men burst into the podium, Pisarev's words were no longer disputed.  A small part of the deputies also suffered. Now at the head of the country are the black-hundredists, headed by Peter Krasnov, and the whole fate of the white movement is in their hands."

Now we have a rather meager supply of money and can hardly afford to sign the same contract again. Right now we have too many money holes to patch up. Ukraine has already offered to reduce the amount of purchases by 70%, but only if Crimea allows some Ukrainian agronomic companies to buy crop land in Crimea. Although it is already obvious that this deal is rather unfavorable for Ukraine, Crimea, due to this agreement, may lose its independence in the agricultural sector, which in turn will only play into the hands of Ukraine."

[ENG.GetName] believes that in order to maintain a balance of power on the continent, these peoples must be free and our government here must set an example for others, and not strive to restore the Russian Empire to its maximum borders.

Since the new government is positioning itself as truly popular, supporters of assigning the status of the second state language to the Russian staged mass protests against the current language legislation.

Undoubtedly, Bolbochan's general skills will come in handy on the battlefields, and the very return of the hero of the liberation war will raise the morale of the army. However, in this case, he will no longer be able to participate in the work of the headquarters and the training of infantry divisions in the army as a whole."

Perhaps this is a really good chance to secure our eastern borders, the idea of intervening in a civil war with neighbors excites the minds of many Ukrainian military, especially those who served in the imperial army. If we completely refuse to intervene, the hottest heads may try to take power into their own hands. As a compromise, you can send the most ardent anti-Bolsheviks to Russia as volunteers, giving them enough equipment for themselves and the local rebels."

 ukraine.214.d:0 "On the basis of anti-communist hysteria due to our moderate policy regarding the uprising in the USSR, part of the military organized an open uprising in order to change our government. The rebellion began with the fleet in Odessa, where sympathy for the "whites" and nostalgia for Tsarist Russia are still strong. He was supported by both a part of the conservative high command and irresponsible youths from the lower ranks who succumbed to propaganda accusing the Ukrainian government of colluding with the Bolsheviks. However, the main core of our armed forces is loyal to the oath, we are ready to immediately pacify the conspirators."

It seems that the threat of war is really great."

Although Khrushchev was born in the Kursk province in a Russian-speaking family and initially did not have a direct relationship with Ukraine, he worked a lot in the structures of the CPU in exile on the instructions of the party and became his own man among the Ukrainian communists.

This is a good time to raise again the question of ownership of Galicia and Volhynia. In addition to us, some other neighbors will certainly agree to share part of the Polish lands.

 ukraine.249.a:0 "We are waiting."
 ukraine.250.t:0 "Unsuccessful convening conference"
 ukraine.250.d:0 "Unfortunately, too few countries have been taught to participate in the Kyiv Conference so that the Polish government would be considered any requirements for its results. Without open support of other countries, we will not be able to push to Poland for peaceful concessions from its side. There is only a variant of the independent military campaign for the release of Western lands."

 ukraine.251.d:0 "The time has come to put forward our demands on Poland at the Kyiv Conference.

 ukraine.259.d:0 "TThe threat of a Soviet invasion is becoming more and more obvious every day, the intelligence is disappointing. It is necessary to decide how we plan to defend against a numerically superior enemy. The Ukrainian army can boldly fight the enemy on the border without giving up a single piece of Ukrainian land. But on the other hand, more cautious staff officers are in favor of withdrawing our forces to the right bank of the Dnieper in order to shorten the front and take up an advantageous defensive position. However, in this case, we will lose the important industrial centers of the east and north of Ukraine, including the country's second largest city, Kharkiv. Of course, part of the military factories can be prepared for emergency evacuation, and the infrastructure for destruction before the advancing enemy, but would it be right to doom a lot of people to the Bolshevik occupation?"

 ukraine.264.d:0 "The interethnic situation in our united state escalated after the end of the war. The Poles, whom we saved in a difficult time, again remembered that they were once the titular nation in their multinational empire. Now, according to many Polish politicians, Ukrainians are oppressing them and removing them from direct government, and in the future they also see a threat to Polish national identity. The united army, now deprived of a single goal, is also torn apart by contradictions. If we do not return the independence of Poland, then our nationalist government will have to restore the unity of the state with fire and sword. A compromise solution to this crisis is the transfer of power to the so-called Government of National Accord, which will include representatives of all major nationalities of our great power on an equal basis."

 ukraine.266.t:0 "Monarchy"
 ukraine.266.d:0 "Among the political elites, the idea of ​​establishing a monarchy in Ukraine is quite popular, where the monarch will become the leader of the country, but the hetman will remain the head of government and commander-in-chief of the army. The representative of the House of Habsburg, Wilhelm Franz, also known earlier as Vasyl Vyshyvany, is ready to take the Ukrainian throne. This idea will be easily accepted in the conservative Ukrainian society, and such a transformation will also strengthen some of our ties in Europe, it remains only to get the consent of the hetman, who in the old days prevented the emergence of a monarch at the head of his state. Perhaps, besides the Habsburgs, there will be other candidates for the throne."
 ukraine.266.a:0 "Invite Habsburg."
 ukraine.267.t:0 "Canadian volunteers arrived"
 ukraine.267.d:0 "The previously promised Allied help has arrived. Canadian shooters have already reached Odessa and are ready to defend the freedom of the Ukrainian people together with our army."

 ukraine.268.d:0 "The Ukrainian-Polish Association [UKR.GetName] also invites us to join this union, referring to the common historical fate of our peoples. We will be guaranteed an equal status within a single state and the best protection against the encroachments of any external enemies. However, as a result of this merger, or rather even absorption, we will completely lose our own statehood. But, in case of refusal, the opposite side can join us by force, which will lead to many unnecessary casualties among our citizens."

 ukraine.271.b:0 "Refuse."
 ukraine.272.t:0 "Integration of the Budzhak"
 ukraine.272.d:0 "Now Budzhak is fully integrated into our state, instead of a temporary administration, full-fledged authorities are now functioning, and local residents have received Ukrainian citizenship. These lands have long been mastered by the Ukrainian Cossacks, now they have become part of an independent Ukrainian state."
 ukraine.272.a:0 "Together forever."
 ukraine.273.t:0 "Renaming of the Chetatya-Albe"
 ukraine.273.d:0 "After the annexation of Budzhak, it was time to restore historical justice and return the former name to the city at the mouth of the Dniester, which the Romanians had previously renamed the incomprehensible Cetatea-Alba. This city has an old Russian name, Belgorod, so to avoid confusion it can be called Belgorod-Dnestrovsky. Previously, it also bore the Turkish name Akkerman, which is still well known to the residents of the city. There is also a proposal to turn to even more ancient history and return the Greek name of Tire to it. Which option is the most appropriate?"
 ukraine.273.a:0 "Belgorod-Dnestrovsky."
 ukraine.273.b:0 "Ackerman."
 ukraine.273.c:0 "Thira."
 ukraine.273.e:0 "No time for this."
 ukraine.274.t:0 "Budzhak chooses Ukraine"
 ukraine.274.d:0 "The population of Budzhak chose to join us by a majority of votes. Ukraine will have direct access to the mouth of the Danube."
 ukraine.274.a:0 "Welcome Home."
 ukraine.275.t:0 "Budzhak remains in the Romanian hands"
 ukraine.275.d:0 "Unfortunately, the population of Budjak chose Romania by a majority of votes. Apparently, the Romanian occupation has already suppressed the Slavic identity in this glorious Cossack region."
 ukraine.275.a:0 "This is the final results of the plebiscite."
 ukraine.276.t:0 "Branch of Subcarpathian Rus"
 ukraine.276.d:0 "The leader of the regional government of Subcarpathian Rus [CUA.GetLeader] announced that in the current conditions he and his administration take full responsibility for the future of the region entrusted to him. For the period of the war, decrees and laws of the local governance will take precedence over national ones, and the further fate of the region is planned to be decided at a plebiscite, which will take place at an appropriate time. He is clearly backed by allied Ukrainian troops and there is nothing we can do now to curb the pro-Ukrainian separatists."
 ukraine.276.a:0 "This is a sneaky backstab."
 ukraine.277.t:0 "Turkish question"
 ukraine.277.d:0 "[TUR.GetName] is clearly violating its neutral status in the war by allowing Ukrainian warships hostile to us to pass through their Black Sea straits. The Turkish ambassador denies the existence of such agreements with the Ukrainian governance, but our intelligence has enough data on this issue. It can be used as a casus belli, but is it worth it?"
 ukraine.277.a:0 "Yes, it`s better to launch a preemptive strike."
 ukraine.277.b:0 "No, we do not need another front."
 ukraine.278.t:0 "Renaming Novorossiysk"
 ukraine.278.desc.a:0 "After the return of the Kuban to their homeland, the question arose of renaming Novorossiysk, since now this land has nothing to do with either the new or the old Russia. Some suggest renaming it Novy Korsun, as our next Black Sea outpost after Korsun-Sevastopol. You can return the old Greek name of Bata to the city. There is also a more mundane option, to give the city the name Tsemessk by the name of the river and bay on the banks of which it is located."
 ukraine.278.desc.b:0 "After the expulsion of the Bolsheviks and, in general, various kinds of Moscow bosses from the Kuban, the question arose of renaming Novorossiysk, since now this land is not part of big Russia, old or new. The rulers, of course, will be against it, but it is more important to decide what the majority wants, and not just some part of the people. Some suggest renaming it Novy Korsun, after the old name of the Crimean Sevastopol. You can return the old Greek name of Bata to the city. There is also a more mundane option, to give the city the name Tsemessk by the name of the river and bay on the banks of which it is located."

 ukraine.280.d:0 "Green Klin will become a full part of a single Ukrainian state. His current guide agreed that together we will only become stronger."
 ukraine.280.a:0 "Unite, Ukrainians, from the ocean to the ocean."
 ukraine.281.t:0 "[Zkl.GetName] refuses"
 ukraine.281.d:0 "The leader of the Far Eastern Ukrainian State responded to the refusal of our offer to join the Unified Ukraine. Probably the remoteness of this region from our main territories played here a role, while the green wedge retains its own state structure."
 ukraine.281.a:0 "Our doors still remain open ..."
 ukraine.282.t:0 "Integration of the Green Klin"
 ukraine.282.d:0 "Green Klin, the Far Eastern border of Ukraine, has become a full-fledged part of our state. The previous authorities were integrated into our administrative system, and local residents received Ukrainian citizenship."
 ukraine.282.a:0 "Welcome Home"
 ukraine.283.t:0 "Restriction of oil exports"
 ukraine.283.d:0 "[[UKR.GetName], waging a desperate war against the German army, protests against our regular oil supplies to Germany. We try to remain neutral in this confrontation, but now we are required to declare a trade embargo by one of the parties, which will cause a corresponding negative reaction. Our oil owners are being spurred on by temporary sabotage of oil supplies. Should we succumb to this pressure, hoping that the Germans will sympathize with our situation?"
 ukraine.283.a:0 "Agree."
 ukraine.283.b:0 "Refuse."
 ukraine.284.t:0 "Romania Agrees"
 ukraine.284.d:0 "The Romanian government met us halfway and announced the revision of contracts for the supply of oil to Germany in order to avoid a confrontation with us. This can clearly complicate the situation of the German army, whose mechanical parts consume a lot of fuel."
 ukraine.284.a:0 "Excellent move."
 ukraine.285.t:0 "Romania Refuses"
 ukraine.285.d:0 "The Romanian government refused to limit the supply of petroleum products to Germany in a possible way, referring to a possible threat of retreating Romania in our war. Supplies of Romanian oil should be discontinued at any cost."
 ukraine.285.a:0 "This is not a friendly position."
 ukraine.286.t:0 "Deliveries of Romanian oil"
 ukraine.286.d:0 "[ROM.GetName] from today began to limit the supply of petroleum products for our needs under various pretexts. Undoubtedly, they succumbed to the pressure of our opponents in order to strangle the great German army, cutting off all the necessary resources to us."
 ukraine.286.a:0 "This is an excuse for an invasion!"
 ukraine.287.t:0 "Ukrainian delegation"
 ukraine.287.d:0 "Fruitful meetings were held with the Ukrainian delegation, which included a lot of military personnel, to improve the interaction of our defense forces and exchange experience between the French and Ukrainian armies."
 ukraine.287.a:0 "Excellent."
 ukraine.288.t:0 "Agreement with Ukraine"
 ukraine.288.d:0 "The delegation from the socialist Ukraine offers us active cooperation between our states for the sake of peace and prosperity in Europe. Ukraine and France can counter the growing German threat from both sides, the Ukrainian government only asks for technical assistance in the development and implementation of modern military equipment, as well as, if possible, to fix mutual security guarantees."

 ukraine.288.b:0 "Refuse, we are not threatened by anything."
 ukraine.289.t:0 "French support"
 ukraine.289.d:0 "[FRA.GetName] agreed to deepen cooperation between our states by providing us with technological support and signing a number of agreements on other issues. We have enlisted the support of another strong ally in Europe, together we will fight to the end for the rights of the working people and crush any fascist sprouts on the continent."
 ukraine.289.a:0 "It`s beneficial for everyone."
 ukraine.290.t:0 "French indifferent"
 ukraine.290.d:0 "[Fra.GetName] did not show live interest in the intensification of cooperation between our states. Apparently, the French government does not understand the threats that navigated over the French people for which it is necessary to combine the efforts of friendly states."
 ukraine.290.a:0 "It will backfire on them."
 ukraine.291.t:0 "Real Patriotism"
 ukraine.291.d:0 "A group of senior Soviet officers headed by Lieutenant General Vlasov came over to our side. They are ready to fight against the Bolsheviks in order to build a new Russia, Vlasov has already called on all Russian people, with the help of leaflets distributed by us, to rise up to fight against Stalin and his clique. He accuses them of creating an anti-human repressive machine that has already ground many human lives in order to strengthen the Bolshevik usurpers in power. This is a great victory for Ukraine, if not military, then at least propaganda."
 ukraine.291.a:0 "He will be an example to the rest."
 ukraine.292.t:0 "Vile betrayal"
 ukraine.292.d:0 "A group of our officers committed an act of monstrous betrayal by agreeing to cooperate with the enemy to overthrow the Bolshevik system. They were headed by General Andrey Vlasov, previously treated kindly by our military propaganda, which only aggravates the situation. An atmosphere of distrust now reigns in our headquarters, it is not known where traitors, for whom nothing is sacred, could still be."
 ukraine.292.a:0 "The fate of traitors is an eternal shame."
 ukraine.293.t:0 "Counteracting the Orthodox Intelligentsia"
 ukraine.293.d:0 "The state anti-clerical policy and the introduction everywhere of the teaching of evolutionary theory instead of theological sciences is met with rejection not only among the dark masses, but, oddly enough, among the very enlightened sections of the population. In particular, the teachers of one of the metropolitan universities refused to remove the study of the foundations of creationism from the program, citing the need to present a variety of 'scientific' points of view in the curriculum. And a number of well-known publicists and cultural figures have joined forces in organizing the Protest Movement Against Evolution in order to discredit the state campaign for the secularization of society. It is necessary to develop effective approaches to remove this obstacle in order to continue the state course."
 ukraine.293.a:0 "Progress cannot be stopped."
 ukraine.294.t:0 "Confiscation of church lands"
 ukraine.294.d:0 "Churches and monasteries own a great deal of valuable land, both agricultural and otherwise, which the state could better use for its projects. The Commissariat of the National Economy has already prepared a list of such territories, it is only necessary to issue a decree. There is nothing for these parasites to hold vast areas when many poor peasants do not own even an inch of land."
 ukraine.294.a:0 "Carry out a confiscation."
 ukraine.294.b:0 "No need, there is enough land for everyone."
 ukraine.295.t:0 "Opening of the anti-religious museum"
 ukraine.295.d:0 "In the building of the previously closed Vladimir Cathedral in Kyiv, the Museum of Anti-Religious Propaganda was solemnly opened. It contains many exhibits that demonstrate the worst phenomena in the history of religion and ridicule the most ridiculous religious tenets. Visiting it was made free of charge, and in the very first days one could observe a significant excitement among our citizens who actively visited the museum. Undoubtedly, the activities of such an institution will help in carrying out our anti-religious campaign, especially if this experience is extended to the regions."
 ukraine.295.a:0 "Excellent work, comrades."
 ukraine.296.t:0 "Activities of religious organizations"
 ukraine.296.d:0 "Previously, there was no clear regulation on the registration of church organizations. They freely conduct their activities according to their internal regulations and still constantly demand tax exemptions. It is necessary to decide whether to introduce strict rules for the registration and activities of such organizations or leave everything as it is in fact. It is also possible, in principle, to prohibit such a term, which will actually turn all church structures into semi-legal civil associations without any rights."
 ukraine.296.a:0 "You don't need to regulate anything."
 ukraine.296.b:0 "Introduce clear rules and restrictions on the registration of organizations."
 ukraine.296.c:0 "Prohibit any official activity of such organizations."
 ukraine.297.t:0 "Seizure of church property"
 ukraine.297.d:0 "In this difficult time, when many peasants are still threatened by starvation, and the state treasury often lacks funds for some basic humanitarian projects, numerous church organizations continue to actively collect "donations" from parishioners. Over the centuries of this undisguised robbery, churches have accumulated many items made of gold and precious stones that could better serve the Ukrainian people than utensils for church services. Some members of the party propose to hold an action to seize surplus church treasures, which are not of great cultural and artistic value, in order to help the poor and pay off the state debt. Of course, the clergy and other parasites will be extremely unhappy with this."
 ukraine.297.a:0 "Run an action."
 ukraine.297.b:0 "Don't stir up a hornet's nest."
 ukraine.298.t:0 "Kuz'kina Mat`"
 ukraine.298.d:0 "The Ukrainian leader [UKR.GetLeader], speaking to foreign journalists, launched an angry tirade against our capitalist enemies. “We have means at our disposal that will have dire consequences for you. We will show you Kuz'kina Mat`!” he said from the podium. Probably, the translators did not cope with the last expression, and many Ukrainian citizens also did not understand what it was about, but on the whole, this militant speech was to the liking of the common people."
 ukraine.298.a:0 "The main thing is that the victory will be for us."
 ukraine.299.t:0 "The fate of Bessarabia"
 ukraine.299.d:0 "After the establishment of control over the main part of Bessarabia it was time to decide from its further situation in our state. It is possible to finally enlarge this territory that was once in place of the Slavic tribes of the tiversers, but now for the most part is populated by Romanian-in-lived residents. However, for greater tranquility in these lands we can and provide the local population with wide autonomy. It will also be possible to consider the ability to exchange the population, citing the main part of local is Molded for the rod, replacing them with the Rusian population from Romanian lands, but the possibility of doing this option else under the question."
 ukraine.299.a:0 "Just annex the territory."
 ukraine.299.b:0 "Organize the Moldovan autonomy."
 ukraine.299.c:0 "Suggest Romania exchange by the population."
 ukraine.300.t:0 "Exchange of population with Ukraine"

 ukraine.301.t:0 "[Rom.GetName] agrees"
 ukraine.301.d:0 "The Romanian side agreed to the exchange of population in Bessarabia. Thus, we will be able to Slavicize this border territory in the shortest possible time."
 ukraine.301.a:0 "Good outcome."
 ukraine.302.t:0 "[ROM.GetName] refuses"
 ukraine.302.d:0 "Romanian governance rejected our proposal to exchange Slavic and Romanian-speaking population. Probably Romanians still hope in the future to return a bassarabus, which of course, is not possible."

# Ukraine.303 - Hidden Event Without Description
 ukraine.304.t:0 "[Ukr.GetName] asks to transfer the territory."
 ukraine.304.d:0 "Our Ukrainian ally asks to transfer to him the city of Starodub with the surroundings. This small region in the past was closely related to other Ukrainian lands in the Russian Empire. The Ukrainian side hopes that our current friendly relationships will also beged our old friendly relationship."

 ukraine.305.t:0 "[BUL.GetName] asks for our support."
 ukraine.305.d:0 "[BUL.GetLeader] turned to us with a request to protect against the pressure of Romania, because of which [BUL.GetName] risks is to lose independence. If [Ukr.GetName] gave guarantees of independence to the brotherly Bulgarian people, then Romanians would twice twice before extending their ultimatums."
 ukraine.305.a:0 "Agree to give guarantees."
 ukraine.305.b:0 "No, we can not go against Romania."
 ukraine.306.t:0 "[BUL.GetName] is given Ukrainian support."
 ukraine.306.d:0 "The Bulgarian leader managed to somehow achieve security guarantees for its country from Ukraine. If we continue to take aggressive steps against Bulgaria, then for it can take up [UKR.GetName]"

 ukraine.308.t:0 "Bun in the south"
 ukraine.308.d:0 "As a result of the activities of Soviet agents and instigators, mass unrest broke out in the south of our country. In the ranks of the Ukrainian military sailors, a rebellion also ripened, armed detachments of sailors and local lumpen seized government institutions in Odessa and some other coastal cities, proclaiming the Odessa Soviet Republic there. The separatists also captured our fleet and began to fortify their positions. The Ukrainian armed forces can easily suppress this puppet misunderstanding, but the Soviet governance is again openly threatening us with war in the event of a large-scale use of force. The Bolsheviks demand the withdrawal of our troops, because of which we will lose the fleet and access to the sea."
 ukraine.309.t:0 "Ukraine leaves Odessa"
 ukraine.309.d:0 "The bourgeois Ukrainian government became frightened and withdrew its troops from the areas engulfed by the unrest organized by us."

 ukraine.311.t:0 "Renaming Krasnodar"
 ukraine.311.desc.a:0 "It is also desirable to rename Krasnodar, which is already a full-fledged Ukrainian city, and not someone's foreign gift. Some Cossacks proposed to rename the city to Novaya Sich, since such a Cossack camp was located in its place during the resettlement of the Cossacks to this region. From other Kuban Cossacks, a proposal was received to perpetuate the name of Nikolai Ryabovol, the head of the Kuban Rada, who was treacherously killed by the White Guards during the civil war. Another interesting idea is the Greek name for the old name of the Kuban River - Gipanispol."

Another interesting idea is the Greek name for the old name of the Kuban River - Gipanispol. Only linemen are not satisfied with either the current name or the proposed options. However, returning the name Yekaterinodar to the city would probably be the least appropriate option in the current situation."

 ukraine.312.t:0 "Multi-station movement"
 ukraine.312.d:0 "In the conditions of the danger looming over the Motherland, the movement of multi-machine workers was born and gained strength among the workers of the Kharkov military factories. Production leaders are calling on factory workers to switch to multi-machine service in order to increase labor efficiency and accelerate the transition of the Ukrainian economy to a military footing.

 ukraine.314.t:0 "Ukrainian pressure"
 ukraine.314.d:0 "The Ukrainian delegation, with which we are in tense negotiations on guarantees of mutual security, is increasingly demanding that we enter into an unequal alliance with Ukraine. [UKR.GetLeader] demands that our united Poland be transformed into a federation in which at least Ukrainians and Belarusians will be endowed with broad autonomy. This way we can maintain at least some control over these lands. Otherwise, [UKR.GetName] threatens to unilaterally revise the Polish-Ukrainian border."
 ukraine.314.a:0 "This is not a sunset, but only a new page in the history of the Commonwealth."
 ukraine.314.b:0 "No, we will not allow anyone to impose our conditions."
 ukraine.315.t:0 "[POL.GetName] yields to our requirements"
 ukraine.315.d:0 "The Polish government is compelled in the current circumstances to agree to an alliance with us in order to preserve its independence.

 ukraine.316.t:0 "[Pol.GetName] refuses"
 ukraine.316.d:0 "The Polish government refuses to continue negotiations on the conclusion of a union treaty. Our demands do not suit the Poles, they still hope to keep their multinational empire intact, being in a hostile environment from all sides.

 ukraine.317.d:0 "[UKR.GetName] is sending us his naval attache, who is to discuss with us the development of the allied fleet in the Baltic.

 ukraine.318.d:0 "Now the Transcarpathian professor Avgustin Voloshin, a prominent Ukrainophile figure in Subcarpathian Rus, is visiting Kyiv for several lectures at Kyiv universities. He requested to meet with any of the representatives of the top Ukrainian governance to discuss the issue of providing support to his pro-Ukrainian movement. The meeting, of course, will be confidential and should not worsen our relations with Czechoslovakia, but will we benefit from this?"
 ukraine.318.a:0 "Yes, it is worth paying a little attention and supporting the Ukrainian brothers."
 ukraine.318.b:0 "No, the Transcarpathian lands will not be our priority in the future."
 ukraine.319.t:0 "Petlyura vs. Bolbochan"
 ukraine.319.d:0 "A serious conflict is brewing among the high military command of the Ukrainian army. Recently appointed to a field post, Pyotr Bolbochan incites other generals against Marshal Petlyura, whom he accuses of incompetence and a desire to impose his political situation on all the military. He believes that in our conditions it is not the time for politicians to play "soldiers". Petlyura is already beginning to suspect Bolbochan of almost preparing a putsch against the legitimate government. Some of them must leave their command post before it's too late."

 ukraine.322.t:0 "[From.GetName] resists"
 ukraine.322.d:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Communist accomplices do not want to accept our conditions for ensuring peace and order in this country.

 ukraine.323.desc.a:0 "The unfinished counter-revolutionary elements among the Don Cossacks, incited by the Ukrainian military, raised an armed uprising in the south of our great motherland. The fact that they have a large number of weapons and the good organization of armed gangs clearly indicates significant Ukrainian support.

 ukraine.324.d:0 "[From.GetAdjective] The army has been ordered to retreat from insurrectionary areas.

 ukraine.325.t:0 "[From.GetName] going on the offensive"
 ukraine.325.d:0 "[From.GetName] reacted aggressively to our provocation by inciting uprisings in his territory. [From.GetAdjective] The army attacked both the rebels and our troops on the border, seeking to launch an effective preemptive strike. Undoubtedly, the Ukrainian army will withstand this blow with honor and move on to the liberation offensive to the east."
 ukraine.325.a:0 "This war was inevitable."
 ukraine.326.t:0 "Arrival of Trotsky"
 ukraine.326.d:0 "The famous Lev Trotsky, a communist, revolutionary and writer, who was expelled from the Soviet Union for opposing Stalin and accused of everything from military failures to industrial accidents, arrived in Ukraine from Norway. He was forced to leave Norway and is now asking for asylum in our country, in his homeland, having learned about the softening of Ukrainian legislation regarding leftists. \n\nTrotsky claims, referring to his numerous articles, that he has always been a supporter of the existence of an independent Ukrainian state, and is now ready to help the Ukrainian governance with councils on the issue of confronting the Stalinist USSR if he is granted asylum here. Such a step of ours would not please Stalin at all, but when did we care about his feelings?"
 ukraine.326.a:0 "Give Trotsky asylum, he might come in handy."

 ukraine.327.desc.a:0 "Remnant counter-revolutionary elements among the Kuban Cossacks and the pro-Ukrainian underground raised an armed uprising in the Kuban. The fact that the rebels have a large number of weapons and the good organization of armed gangs clearly indicates significant Ukrainian support.

 ukraine.328.d:0 "In the Japan, the Ukrainian delegation arrived to agree on the expansion of cooperation between our countries, first of all in the naval area. Another of her secret goal is to attempt to convince us to open the second front against [Sov.GetAdjective] army. [Ukr.GetName] holds a heavy, but quite successful war and offers to divide Russian territories after victory. From a powerful blow from the second side [Sov.GetName] collapses much faster."
 ukraine.328.a:0 "Accept the offer completely, we are preparing for a new campaign."
 ukraine.328.b:0 "We do not need a new war, but the imperial fleet is ready to share its experience."
 ukraine.328.c:0 "All these proposals do not bring any benefit to Japan."
 ukraine.329.t:0 "Success in Japan"
 ukraine.329.d:0 "Our delegation in Japan has achieved significant success. The Japanese agreed to share their experience in the reform of the Navy, and also seriously consider the opportunity to start the offensive on the USSR from the East. A new ally will not interfere with us now to achieve victory, so this war will end much faster."
 ukraine.329.a:0 "[Sov.GetAdjective] The bear will get a blow to the back."
 ukraine.330.t:0 "Mixed successes in Japan"
 ukraine.330.d:0 "Our delegation in Japan has achieved only a part of the tasks assigned to it. The Japanese agreed to share their experience in reforming the Navy, but did not give any encouraging hints about going against the USSR. Perhaps the Imperial Japanese Army is still under the influence of a number of early border battles in which they were defeated by the [SOV.GetAdjective] army, although we have already demonstrated from our own experience that this devil is not so terrible."
 ukraine.330.a:0 "With such hesitation, they will never achieve great success."
 ukraine.331.t:0 "The failure of the mission in Japan"
 ukraine.331.d:0 "Our delegation in Japan was unable to fulfill the tasks assigned to it. The Japanese dignitaries listened to us very attentively and smiled a lot, but they were in no hurry to sign any useful agreements. Our fleet will not receive any significant support, and the participation of Japan in the war against an enemy such as [SOV.GetName] is not worth thinking about in the short term."

 ukraine.332.t:0 "Oil concession"
 ukraine.332.d:0 "[From.GetName] plans to increase its influence in the region and proposes that we grant a concession to some of the promising oil fields.

 ukraine.333.t:0 "[From.GetName] approves the deal"
 ukraine.333.d:0 "[From.GetName] agrees to give us a concession of part of its oil fields. This is a good start to increase our presence in the Middle East.

 ukraine.333.a:0 "We have new prospects."
 ukraine.334.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuses the transaction"
 ukraine.334.d:0 "[From.GetName] does not want to give us anything in concession. Apparently, [From.GetAdjective] is not sure of its beneficiary, or the current owners of most of the Middle Eastern oil persuaded them not to enter the new participants into this area. Contracts for the supply of weapons also became irrelevant."

 ukraine.335.t:0 "Sale of Kuwait"
 ukraine.335.d:0 "[UKR.GetName] offers us to sell our naval base in Kuwait for a favorable price, which will be transferred within a year.

Britain may not benefit from such a scenario, but we already have so many bases in the Persian Gulf, and Kuwait is still not much use now."
 ukraine.335.a:0 "Agree."
 ukraine.336.t:0 "Base in Kuwait is Bought"
 ukraine.336.d:0 "[From.GetName] agrees to sell its database in Kuwait for our generous payment. During the year it will be necessary to pay the entire amount. Thus, the Ukrainian fleet has a base for new abruses that prevent the ways to India and further to the East. It is also worth considering the development of oil fields in the surrounding area with the surrounding area, our oil workers have a fairly experience extent."
 ukraine.336.a:0 "The window in India is opened."
 ukraine.337.t:0 "The deal did not take place"
 ukraine.337.d:0 "[From.GetName] does not agree to sell Kuwait to us. It seems that the British consider us with their potential opponents and will will oppose any attempts by Ukraine to gain a foothold in this region."

 ukraine.338.desc.a:0 "Bourgeois Belarusian nationalists, incited by the Ukrainian military, organized a massive armed uprising on the western borders of the country in the BSSR, raising their heads for the first time after the failed Slutsk uprising. The fact that they have a large number of weapons and the good organization of armed gangs clearly indicates significant Ukrainian support. The Ukrainian army has also recently been concentrating near our borders, probably preparing at the right time to support the rebels through direct aggression. Should we resolutely crush the uprising and launch a preemptive strike on Ukraine, or is it better to retreat in this situation for the time being?"

 ukraine.340.t:0 "Black Sea doctrine"
 ukraine.340.d:0 "The geopolitical concept called the "Black Sea Doctrine" was developed by the Ukrainian publicist and political scientist Yuriy Lipa. It was accepted by the Hetman's government as a whole as a model for building the future foreign policy of Ukraine.\n\nLipa determines the important role of the Black Sea for all Black Sea countries (Ukraine, Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey), and Ukraine is a kind of overlapping of the sea - a vault, and this arch extends from the west from the Prut River and Transcarpathia, based on the Danube, to the east into the region of Transcaucasia and Iran, based on the Caspian Sea. The vault itself rests on the Crimean peninsula, and Belarus serves as the key to it, and it stretches from north to south for hundreds of kilometers. \n\nBelarus plays a very important role in the security of Ukraine, it can be compared to a helmet protecting the head of Ukraine. If it fails to create a separate friendly Belarusian state, then Belarus will be a wound on the neck of Ukraine, since it can become an instrument of its eastern or western neighbors.\n\nTavrida, that is, Crimea, is the center of all sea routes of the Black Sea and a tool that can revive activity on throughout the north coast. This name emphasizes the deep historical connection with the entire continental Ukraine and presented Ukraine's rights to Crimea.\n\nFor the security of Ukraine, it is necessary to ensure the security of the Dniester from the west and the Don from the east. Control of the Dniester will allow control of the Siret, Tisza and Prut, as well as control of the Danube.\n\nControl of the Don will allow control of the Volga and the Caspian Sea region, as well as guarding Ukraine's routes south to Iran. However, the main task of the Don is to protect the resources of the Donetsk region, the Azov region and all of Central Ukraine along with the Crimea.\n\nYuriy Lipa is convinced of the expediency of creating a Black Sea-Baltic federation between Ukrainians, Belarusians, Poles and Lithuanians, where Ukraine would play a major role."
 ukraine.340.a:0 "It is clear."
 ukraine.341.t:0 "A Woman General?"
 ukraine.341.d:0 "After the liberalization of our legislation, many previously closed doors opened for Ukrainian women. They can now occupy any military and administrative positions if they have the required qualifications. Now the political elite, for their propaganda reasons, is pushing the idea of promoting one of the few women in the Ukrainian army to the rank of general. The main candidate here is Kristina Sushko, medical officer and wife of retired General Roman Sushko. She earned a good reputation during the war of independence, and even without the normal experience of commanding military formations, she can bring some of her innovations to high positions in the army."
 ukraine.341.a:0 "Raise Sushko."
 ukraine.341.b:0 "No, this populism is harmful, women are not yet ready for such responsibility."
 ukraine.342.t:0 "Elections [GetYear] of the year"
 ukraine.342.d:0 "The day of the presidential elections has come. Symon Petliura successfully democratized the Ukrainian political system and carried out many important reforms for our people.\n\nHis measures had some success, but his active foreign policy stance draws criticism from the party opposition headed by Isaac Mazepa, an experienced parliamentarian who for a long time represented the interests of the hetman democratic opposition in the Rada. Mazepa represents the left-wing populist wing of the ruling party and suggests focusing on domestic affairs to build a prosperous Ukraine."
 ukraine.342.a:0 "Petlyura. He should complete his undertakings."
 ukraine.342.b:0 "Mazepa. Our party has always been with a simple people."
 ukraine.343.t:0 "Change of the Supreme governance"
 ukraine.343.d:0 "On the next Plenum of the ruling party was raised a long-term draft of the change of power in socialist Ukraine. [Ukr.GetLeader] has been working great at work, but we must remember that the lack of replacement in the highest governance leads to the dictatorship like the Stalin`s. If the current head of state lost its firm support, then this should be discussed in order to take and take appropriate measures."

 ukraine.343.e:0 "Leon Trotsky is a true revolutionary."
 ukraine.344.t:0 "Language Reform"
 ukraine.344.d:0 "It is time to resolve the language issue, which has taken its permanent place on the political agenda. Previously, it was planned in the course of administrative reform to allow individual regions to decide for themselves which languages of national minorities to give official status. But is it worth making compromises on the issue of building a single national state, is it not better to continue the policy of Ukrainization in full? In the long term, this will ensure greater unity of the Ukrainian people. On the other hand, giving Russian the status of a second state language would improve relations with Soviet Russia and could also provide additional options in the future in countering the Soviet threat, despite the current possible dissatisfaction of patriotic citizens."
 ukraine.344.a:0 "Continue active Ukrainization."
 ukraine.344.b:0 "Allow regional languages."
 ukraine.344.c:0 "Give the Russian language the status of a second state language."
 ukraine.345.t:0 "Partial success of the uprising"
 ukraine.345.d:0 "The riots fueled by our efforts in the southeastern regions of Ukraine unexpectedly ended with the Ukrainian government seizing the initiative and agreeing with the rebels on granting broad autonomy to the seething regions. The further escalation of the conflict was probably prevented by Ukraine's earlier liberal policy regarding the rights of Russian-speaking citizens."
 ukraine.345.a:0 "It will weaken them anyway.."
 ukraine.346.t:0 "Renaming Stalingrad"
 ukraine.346.d:0 "Stalingrad has now become part of the Ukrainian state and it is worth thinking about what name to give it so as not to perpetuate the name of the bloody tyrant. You can return to him the old name Tsaritsyn (in no way connected in fact with Russian tsarism) or give the neutral name Volgograd. There is also a proposal to rename the city in honor of Hetman Skoropadsky, who achieved independence for Ukraine and laid the foundation for the current success of our country. Which option would be better here? "

 ukraine.348.d:0 "The Ukrainian government, which has long had plans for some of our territories, insistently demands that the territory of Bessarabia and Bukovina be divided according to a more 'fair' principle. We were reminded of the dubious grounds on which we acquired these territories after the Great War, and they propose to transfer to Ukraine the northern part of Bukovina and the southern corner of Bessarabia, inhabited mainly by Slavs. After that, [UKR.GetName] will agree to guarantee the territorial integrity of Romania within the resulting borders. In case of refusal, [UKR.GetName] will consider us as an unfriendly neighbor that infringes on the rights of Ukrainians."
 ukraine.348.a:0 "Agree, we already have too many enemies planned."

 ukraine.349.a:0 "This will serve the case of the world."
 ukraine.350.t:0 "Romania rejects the redistribution of the boundaries"
 ukraine.350.d:0 "Romania refuses to discuss substantive changes to its borders. Apparently, [ROM.GetLeader] believes that constant discrimination against the Ukrainian diaspora in Romania will continue to get away with it."

 ukraine.353.t:0 "[From.GetName] devils the proposal"
 ukraine.353.d:0 "[From.GetName] has rejected our proposals to strengthen the alliance and does not agree to give up its independence within the framework of the common alliance. This is, of course, their right, but allied obligations must be fulfilled, otherwise how can we rely on them?"

The enemy is advancing and has already captured a significant part of Ukraine, we are facing the threat of an inevitable loss of statehood, which has already befallen many other peoples of Europe. Our allies are either defeated or too far away to help.\n\nIn such a situation, defeatism grows in the army and all sorts of intrigues are woven. General Konovalets said in a private conversation with the Minister of War that he had already entered into negotiations with the Germans about the future of our country. He claims that he will be able to agree with the enemy on a separate peace, according to which the state will be saved, although it will fall under the strong influence of Germany, which has gained power. Of course, many concessions will have to be made, including territorial ones, but what could be more important than the preservation of the Ukrainian state. Is this offer worth considering?"

But if we accept the principle of one Ukrainian nation, one steel will, one common victory, then it is worth making an agreement with the nationalists and accepting their help in organizing and replenishing the army.

All the threads of this ominous web converge on Alexander Osetsky, Skoropadsky's most trusted commander in the last years of the Hetmanate. Now he is inciting other generals to a possible rebellion if the leadership of Ukraine takes, in his opinion, rash steps in foreign policy. These officers, accustomed to a well-fed peaceful life, do not understand how important it is for the future of the Ukrainian nation to act decisively and aggressively, to strengthen the offensive capabilities of our land army and all other military branches. Of course, we would like to do without bloodshed, but if we have to wage a holy war for the unification of Ukrainian lands, then we will not tolerate wavering and defeatist commanders at headquarters and at the front.\n\nThere are also doubts about some generals suspected of being communist sympathizers. In particular, Nikolai Shapoval regularly communicates with some of his relatives, who are seen in the spread of leftist ideas among the poorly educated people. It is not known whether he is also in some kind of conspiracy with Osetsky, but it is better to deal with everyone at once, while there is time.\n\nOur agents of the party security service have already collected impressive dirt on the main participants in potential problems, you can either blackmail them with the same Ossetsky and remove him from key posts so that he does not stick out anymore, or, on the basis of this information, arrange a military tribunal over all those who have become a burden for the Ukrainian army in order to expel them from its ranks with shame."

The rebels were taken under control of several large cities, but due to the faithfulness of most of the army they did not get out of the right of the country at all.

Melnyk is supported by such respected members of the party as Senik and Stsiborsky, their organizational talents could still be useful in the new vertical of power. But is it worth putting up with their manners when the Ukrainian people look to our party as a guide in reviving the glory and power of Ukraine?\n\n One can, of course, make some limited compromises, promising the Melnykites to improve relations with the Germans in the future and even try to enlist them military support, but on the condition that this will be the first and last such proposal from Stepan Bandera. If they do not agree, they will have to leave the party forever and end their political activities, and preferably peacefully and voluntarily, otherwise these zealous oppositionists will quickly exchange the spacious corridors of power for cramped prison cells."

Bandera is supported by such respected members of the party as Rebet and Stetsko, their organizational talents could still be useful in the new vertical of power. But is it worth it to endure their manners when the Ukrainian people look to our party as a guide in reviving the glory and power of Ukraine?\n\nOf course, some limited compromises can be made, promising the Banderaites to conduct more active foreign policy activities in the near future, but on condition that this will be the first and last such proposal from Andrey Melnyk.

We, as allies of Bulgaria, must of course support their claims, however, Romania should not be written off, for the common good of all members of the alliance, allied Romania in the future can provide significant support to strengthen peace in the region. If Ukraine supports Bulgaria, then our armies will be drawn into a new bloody war, but otherwise relations with the Bulgarian government will become very cold.

Ukrainian border guards in the port of Odessa detained a Soviet citizen who introduced himself as Yakov Blumkin, a famous Soviet saboteur and adventurer, about whom, however, nothing was heard in recent years. It was even believed that Blumkin was arrested and executed by Chekists for ties with the Trotskyists. Now this rogue claims that it was not him who was seized while passing the border control, but he himself surrendered to escape the threat of being liquidated. During interrogation, Blumkin told an incredible story that he was really arrested in the USSR and almost executed, and now they have sent him to Ukraine to liquidate Trotsky, after which the Soviet governance promises to pardon the disgraced agent, but the latter does not want to kill the leader of the Trotskyist movement and his idol, moreover, he doubts that he will really get a pardon in the country of the Soviets after that. Therefore, he asks for political asylum with us, promising to work for us. against the Soviet agents, about which Blumkin can still tell a lot of interesting things.

In the near future, it is necessary to hold the ceremony of the coronation of the monarch, which is a very new experience for our country. It is possible to arrange an expensive holiday from this ceremony with many invited foreign guests, which will get into all the news and immediately strengthen the position of the newly-minted royal house of Ukraine. However, our country is still recovering from the economic crisis, and the traditions of coronations have not yet been formed, is it worth starting immediately with expensive fun, when every hryvnia can matter in the future?"

Archduke Wilhelm Franz of Habsburg-Lorraine, in an open carriage, accompanied by a large retinue and ceremonial regiments, including those from the hetman's regiment, solemnly arrived at St. Sophia Cathedral. Here, in the presence of numerous foreign guests and journalists, he received, as a compromise, blessings for the reign from the primate of the still unrecognized Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the primate of the UGCC Andriy Sheptytsky and the papal legate, after which he laid on himself a luxurious crown, made by the best Kyiv jewelers according to a special order. The fact of the presence of various church hierarchs and the Galician lion on the crown should symbolize the succession of the throne from King Daniel of Galicia and the fact that he will be the king of all Ukrainians, including those from the western lands. The new king took the name of Vasily I and in the Ukrainian language, which he had long ago learned, swore to take care of the well-being of the entrusted people and defend the independence of the Ukrainian state. Then a salute was given from a hundred guns, under which the king and distinguished guests went to the coronation ball at the Mariinsky Palace, and mass festivities began on Sofiyskaya Square and in some other parts of the capital. The holiday lasted until late at night, fortunately, this day was declared a holiday in advance.\n\nThis event will be discussed for a long time both in Ukraine and abroad, because not every year a new monarchy is born with its attractive and pompous ceremonies."

Archduke Wilhelm Franz of Habsburg-Lorraine, in an ordinary car with a modest retinue, arrived at the Mariinsky Palace, where, in the presence of the hetman and other senior officials, he received royal regalia, including a fairly inexpensive gilded crown. Those present drank a glass to the health of the king, after which the king went out to the crowd of people near the palace and in Ukrainian, which he had long ago learned, delivered a short coronation speech. After that, he, along with a number of other dignitaries, went to celebrate the event in an informal setting. Ordinary people also arranged small festivities, but no large-scale events were prepared, and the people eventually dispersed rather quickly.\n\nThe past ceremony was criticized by many for modesty and transience, ordinary people in a not the richest country always always want bread and circuses, and the beginning of our monarch's reign produced none of this. The ceremony did not make an impression on foreigners and did not give the foreign press reasons for wide discussion."

 ukraine.417.t:0 "Queen`s issue"
 ukraine.417.d:0 "After the accession of Vasily I to the throne, the issue of the king's marriage turned from a personal matter into a matter of national importance. Dynastic marriages should hold together state unions, besides, the monarch will need a legitimate heir in the future. Our king is still single, which gives rise to various obscene assumptions about his preferences and complicates the issue of succession. It is necessary to quickly look for unmarried princesses in Europe who would agree to marry him, thus resolving this delicate issue."

She received a good education in the field of fine arts and for many years was engaged in charitable work, but she never married.\n\nSkoropadsky himself actively supports this marriage, so there are no objections from Elizabeth in such a situation. This alliance will strengthen the connection of the new king with the old Ukrainian elite, which will positively affect the stability of the ruling system, but will not provide any potential benefits in the foreign policy arena."

In December 1933, she became the first member of her family to come to Vienna since the founding of the republic. Adelaide studied at the University of Leuven in Belgium.\n\nPrincess Adelaide accepted an offer from our King Basil and agreed to become his wife. Although they both belong to the house of Habsburg, but to different branches, and such a marriage, in which our king was born, is not something rare and unacceptable.

Emperor Nicholas II became her godfather. After her father Grand Duke Kirill proclaimed himself Emperor Kirill I in 1924, Kira Kirillovna received the title of Grand Duchess from her father.\n\nKira Kirillovna accepted an offer from our King Vasily and agreed to become his wife. This union is quite unexpected for the general public, few expected that the House of Romanov would actually recognize the independence of Ukraine in this way. However, this dynasty is now going through hard times, perhaps the Romanovs hope to someday regain at least part of the former Russian Empire with the help of the Ukrainian army. At the moment, this marriage will only make it possible to establish additional ties with the White Guard movement, which, although it does not unanimously recognize Kira's father as emperor, partially sympathizes with the former owners of the Russian land."

Our king, as usual for the Habsburgs, was brought up in the Catholic faith. Although we have a secular country, the head of state should represent the interests of the majority, and not some foreign church. [Root.GetLeader] has not previously been known to be a very zealous Catholic, it might be easier if he officially converts to Orthodoxy. This will give a positive signal to the Phanar and remove all questions as to whether the monarch and the people of Ukraine are really united in their desire to receive autocephaly."

Particularly valuable may be the military leaders of the Makhnovist anarchist rebels, who were in prison or exile under the Hetmanate, and are now eager to fight again. Of course, they were sometimes situational allies of the Red Army and fought together with the communists for the rights and freedoms of the working class, but at the same time they are too freedom-loving and disorganized compared to our other commanders. Perhaps, without the deceased Nestor Makhno, they will become more manageable and loyal, but the most violent ones, like Shchus, should still be kept away from the command staff of the renewed Ukrainian army. Now they are eager for revenge and rehabilitation after past defeats and repressions in order to again lead the armed people."

The cinema raises the problems of betrayal, pride, mistrust and, of course, national strife. It can be seen with the naked eye that the emphasis is placed precisely on the need for national unity in difficult times. \n \n The hetman himself attended the premiere. In an interview with the Kyiv Kulturniy newspaper, he said that this movie was made for centuries and he had already nominated Dovzhenko and the main actors for the state award."

Perhaps Ukraine should use this opportunity to elevate a friendly ruler to the throne of Moscow, who has a dynastic relationship with the Ukrainian monarchy. Of course, Ukraine will not return under Russian rule, this time the main role will be played by the Mother of Russian cities, Kyiv.

There are five positions in total, from osavul to khorunzhy, you can now donate one of them to increase support for one opposition faction until the next hetman elections.

 ukraine.472.t:0 "Ukrainian Cossack Rada"
 ukraine.472.d:0 " Today, the capital hosted the first meeting of the Ukrainian Cossack Rada, which included representatives of the highest military ranks from all types of troops. This institution, as a result of the constitutional reform, should replace the State Rada, which was assembled from everyone in a row and did not perform any useful functions. Now it is the Cossack Council that will be responsible for the development of the Ukrainian state, which will be in the reliable hands of the military. Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi left his post and, according to the new constitution, headed a special Supreme State Council, which should provide additional control over the Rada and can, in case of special need, veto its decisions. As the new hetman, who would now be elected by the new Rada once a year, Skoropadskyi proposed to elect his son Danylo, which was supported by the majority of deputies. His candidatures for the new positions of the Cossack foreman were also supported: koshevoi captain, general clerk, judge, convoy and cornet.\n\n Despite the fact that the Skoropadsky dynasty continues to control the political life of the country, the Ukrainian Cossack Rada will not always play the role of a hetmans puppet. Its deputies also have their own ambitions, they are already beginning to master their new role and unite in unofficial factions. It is already possible to distinguish four main factions, approximately equal in influence. The first are the so-called Unionists, consistent supporters of the Skoropadskyi, confident that only stable and strong power in the hands of proven leaders can further strengthen Ukrainian statehood. The second faction is the Guards of Order, the core of which consists of old and conservative officers led by Oleksander Beresowski, who strongly dislike the Bolsheviks, but at the same time wished to see Russia as a friendly one after its liberation from the red evil spirits. The third faction has united around the figure of the famous Petro Bolbochan, the Right Wing acts from a nationalist position, but is not associated with the OUN of Konovalets, who is not very popular among military officials. Finally, the remaining members of the Rada united in the so-called Black Rada, which verbally advocates the interests of the lower ranks and the poor, abundantly using populist rhetoric. Their leader was a certain Panas Lyubchenko, a medical officer, about whom they say that even in the tsarist army he distributed communist propaganda, and defected to the side of the Ukrainian army only after its victories over the Bolsheviks (which Lyubchenko himself, of course, denies).\n\n In order to continue to successfully control the Cossack Rada, it will be necessary to establish good relations with all factions, for which you can both cooperate with them and apply pressure."
 ukraine.472.a:0 "Long live the new hetman!"
 ukraine.473.t:0 "Flag and country name"
 ukraine.473.d:0 "One of the last issues that remains to be agreed upon in the wording of the new constitution is the name and symbols of the country. Since our Ukrainian statehood is now officially based on the traditions of the Zaporizhzhya Cossacks, many deputies propose to adopt the large banner of the Zaporozhian Sich as a flag, and now the state is called nothing more than the Ukrainian Sich, in order to reflect in this way the leading position of the military Cossack estate in the country. But more conservative deputies do not want to abandon the old symbols, because there are other pages of Ukrainian history besides the Cossacks, and the current symbolism better reflects the connection with ancient times, besides, many in the world and Ukraine are too used to it. It is necessary to make a final decision without unnecessary delay."
 ukraine.473.a:0 "Change official name and symbols."
 ukraine.473.b:0 "Leave it as is."
 ukraine.474.t:0 "How this system works"
 ukraine.474.d:0 "Elections of the hetman and the Cossack foremen from the osavul to the khorunzhy are held once a year. In order for the current hetman to retain his post, he needs to achieve the support of at least two factions by the time of the next vote, not counting his own (the current pro-government faction always supports its hetman 100%). Support is considered sufficient if its level is 80 or higher. Also, such support gives the maximum positive effect from a particular faction, with a support level of 51 to 79, the bonus is smaller or absent, with 50 or less, the faction is already completely in opposition.\n\nIf you managed to achieve the support of only one opposition faction, then most likely it will work it is to bring her to power, tk. this support is mutual. In the absence of any support, the Black Rada has the greatest chance of winning on contradictions, but there are some other conditions. In some cases, the faction supports the current hetman in the elections, even if relations have not been established with it during the year: Guards of Order support in the war with Soviet Russia or an alliance with non-Soviet Russia, the Right Wing - if all the main national territories of Ukraine are united, the Black Rada moderates oppositional ardor with greater stability. If Pavel Skoropadsky is alive and holds his special position, then the decision of the Rada can be vetoed and his son brought to power for a year.\n\nFive positions of the Cossack foreman are also chosen together with the hetman, each of them can be loyal, neutral or disloyal to the current hetman . Loyal ones give the indicated bonuses, and disloyal ones - the same penalties. Loyalty status usually does not change throughout the year. To ensure that loyal people are brought in, you need to either get the full support of all factions without promising to give them these positions, or use Pavlo Skoropadskyi powers.\n\nEach faction in power has unique solutions, as well as some of its additional effects or conditions in focuses and solutions. Also, opposition factions can react differently to decisions made and focuses chosen, increasing or decreasing their support for the current hetman."

We will not give up our sovereignty for the whims of Russian tyrants, otherwise the current hetman will be demolished either by the angry people or his entourage. It will be precisely a mutual defense alliance, which will also finally secure the eastern direction for Ukraine. In honor of such an event, [Root.GetLeader] even ordered to rename the city of Pereyaslav to Pereyaslav-Khmelnitsky."

He and his party have lived for many years through the active use of the nationalist agenda, and now, when the power is led by a person with well-known nationalist views, while not joining any party, the OUN monopoly is crumbling before our eyes. Information is coming that Konovalets is actively weaving intrigues at various levels, from the General Staff to the rank and file of individual divisions, in order to discredit our hetman and his entourage. Undoubtedly, this undermines the unity in society, especially among the right. If this splinter is not pulled out now, it will cause some inconvenience for some time."

Additional interest is given by the absence of the author. Or rather, he certainly is. But nothing indicates this.\n\nThe book tells about a certain Ivan from Zaporizhia, who went through the entire war of independence. The book is saturated with the pain of a man who gave everything for the sake of the country. His parents were killed during the first Red offensive. His brothers fell fighting near Odesa, and all his comrades-in-arms rest in the ground. The book ends immediately after the end of the Battle of Kharkiv.

The collective farmers do not cultivate the land taken from the big landowners as efficiently as the hired laborers used to do. It also turned out that the kulak farms, which previously contributed a fairly large share in many categories of agricultural products, after their transfer to common ownership, have significantly lost their efficiency. Because of this, the next harvest, or even several in a row after it, is predicted by the Ministry of Agriculture to be much more meager, to the point that famine may return to some regions, as was the case in the more backward times of Russian tsarism.

All statistics have confirmed previous predictions that inefficient agricultural reforms have endangered our food security for a long time to come. The head of the Council [Root.GetLeader] strongly opposes the purchase of food abroad, as this will cast a shadow on the entire socialist economic model and can be used by our enemies in their propaganda. Instead, he proposes changing the structure of agriculture, in particular, paying more attention to new, promising crops, especially corn, which has the potential to dominate Ukrainian fields and solve many old and new problems. Most of the rank and file members of the Council of Ministers are still inclined towards a more reliable option with foreign purchases. Or maybe you don’t need to do anything and the crisis itself will gradually blow away?"

Now that we have successfully recaptured Lviv, he is once again convinced that we need to listen less to cowardly advisers and take more decisive action. And in the future, our leader intends to make more individual decisions without regard for criticism from party comrades, which he announced in his speech to the working people.\n\nUkrainian newspapers picked up this agenda and began to praise the achievements of Soviet Ukraine under the leadership of Khrushchev in every possible way. 'Comrade Khrushchev’s instructions,” one newspaper wrote, “for our entire people have become a measure of wisdom and the deepest understanding of the objective laws of development.'

For example, he immediately canceled part of the contracts for the supply of army products, concluded under his predecessor, and insisted on the conclusion of new ones, which the company undertook to fulfill, which was directly related to the son-in-law of the convoy. This case could potentially be inflated into a big scandal, which could result in the dismissal of the convoy. But many in the hetman's secretariat are opposed to bringing too much public attention to cases of corruption, but the use of them to ensure the loyalty of the Cossack foreman is already arousing keen interest. Is it worth it to put pressure on the Wagonmaster?"
 ukraine.502.a:0 "Yes, let he be more accommodating."
 ukraine.502.b:0 "No need to cast a shadow over our entire system."
 ukraine.503.t:0 "Annexation of the southeast"
 ukraine.503.d:0 "Today, Ukrainian troops occupied key infrastructure and administrative buildings in Galicia and Volyn to unilaterally announce the re-establishment of the WUPR as an autonomous republic for the Ukrainians of Poland. The puppet government of this so-called republic has already begun to talk about the need to immediately hold a referendum on reunification with Ukraine. Now we cannot oppose anything to this act of violation of the territorial integrity of Poland, but the Polish people will not leave it just like that in the future."
 ukraine.503.a:0 "All these decisions will remain illegitimate."
 ukraine.504.t:0 "Congress of Captive Peoples"
 ukraine.504.d:0 "The Congress of Captive Peoples was held in the Ukrainian capital, to which representatives of the national liberation movements of the peoples occupied by Russia were invited. The Ukrainian people, like no other, knows what it means to be under the Russian heel, so the delegates received significant support from the authorities and public organizations of the capital. Such well-known figures as Noy Zhordania, Mustafa Shokay and Gayaz Iskhaki spoke at the congress. Based on its results, it was decided to intensify the activities of the Promethean movement and organize in Kyiv, following the example of some other European capitals, the Prometheus Club, whose members would be constantly involved in coordinating the national liberation movements of different peoples. It was proposed to elect a retired Ukrainian politician and diplomat Roman Smal-Stotsky as the chairman of the Kyiv club, who made a lot of efforts to organize this congress. All this activity will cause a storm of indignation in the Kremlin, but the democratic government of the Ukrainian People's Republic is always ready to stand on the side of the small enslaved peoples."

 ukraine.505.t:0 "Ukrainian Defense Initiative"
 ukraine.505.d:0 "[From.GetName] stands for the strengthening of peace and stability in Europe, for which he proposes that we and a number of other countries in the region conclude agreements to ensure collective security. If any party to these agreements is subjected to an unprovoked attack by any country, then all other parties to the agreements will have to give the aggressor a joint military rebuff. In this way, Ukraine hopes to establish the principle of the inviolability of borders and save the countries of Eastern Europe from being dismembered by stronger and more aggressive powers."

 ukraine.507.d:0 "[From.GetName] does not want to take part in the establishment of collective security in the region. Representatives of this country do not believe that such agreements are worth anything in our time and plan to pursue a 'more pragmatic' policy in the future."
 ukraine.507.a:0 "Or maybe they themselves are plotting aggression?"
 ukraine.508.t:0 "Call for defensive war"
 ukraine.508.d:0 "Something happened that had to happen sooner or later: [From.GetName] attacked another state, a member of a collective defense initiative, to which our country had previously joined. Now the victim of aggression calls on all participating countries to join this war in order to stop the invader."

The deputies insist that by the end of this funding program, the Ukrainian army will reach the strength of 350,000 soldiers and officers who are fully prepared to do their duty. If this goal is not achieved, some deputies may decide that they are better off continuing to support the populist opposition, which is constantly advocating for a reduction in military spending."
 ukraine.509.a:0 "Will be done."

 ukraine.510.d:0 "The Defense Committee of the Rada agrees to allocate additional funds from the budget for the training and deployment of new military units.

 ukraine.515.t:0 "Forming og WUPR"
 ukraine.515.d:0 "Today, our allied Ukrainian People's Republic dealt the Polish state a vile stab in the back. In the territories of Galicia and Volyn, which, after our government went into exile, continue to successfully defend Ukrainian troops, with direct Ukrainian support, the Western Ukrainian People's Republic was proclaimed as an autonomy within Poland. Even if we discard the fact that such administrative changes were not approved by our government and parliament, we must understand that the ultimate goal of this enterprise is the complete exclusion of our southeastern lands."
 ukraine.515.a:0 "We can't do anything about it yet."
 ukraine.516.t:0 "Failure in the West"
 ukraine.516.d:0 "Our army failed to establish itself properly on the western frontiers after the fall of the Polish government. Because of this, our project for a unilateral announcement of the revival of the WUPR failed, since our army does not hold any significant territories in Galicia or Volhynia under reliable control."
 ukraine.516.a:0 "We will liberate Western Ukraine yet."
 ukraine.517.t:0 "Restoration of WUPR"
 ukraine.517.d:0 "Thanks to the fact that the Polish government fled, and our army successfully continues to hold back the enemy in Western Ukraine, we managed to organize the revival of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic there, which is now proclaimed as an autonomous republic within the Polish state. Poles are forced in their current situation to accept these changes as a given. In the future, the people of WUPR must decide on their future destiny, and we will do everything so that the Ukrainians of Galicia and Volhynia have the opportunity to return to the united Ukraine."

 ukraine.519.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] is not going to fight for Crimea and cedes it to us, allowing the Ukrainian army to occupy the peninsula without a fight.

 ukraine.522.d:0 "A new generation of talented commanders is growing up to replace the generals of the era of the struggle for independence. Today it is worth considering the issue of promotion of the young officer Roman Shukhevych to the rank of general, which will be a good motivation for other officers. Shukhevych is originally from Galicia, but moved to independent Ukraine to serve in its army. For many years he worked closely in military intelligence units, has connections with the nationalist underground in Western Ukraine, commanded detachments that carried out missions outside our country, for which the Ukrainian government cannot yet take responsibility. In the service, he showed himself as a disciplined performer and a skilled organizer, ready to inspire his subordinates by his example."
 ukraine.522.a:0 "Promote."

 ukraine.523.t:0 "Closing of the Promethean Club"

 ukraine.526.t:0 "Khrushchev eager to lead the army"
 ukraine.526.d:0 "Our leader Nikita Khrushchev said that the Ukrainian army, as a result of his correct decisions to re-equip and expand, has become a really big and powerful force, which means that it needs a strong leader who will always lead it to revolutionary victories on the battlefield. Therefore, he wants to lead the command of the ground forces himself, considering his old experience in leading a small partisan detachment and good political training to be quite sufficient for such a role."
 ukraine.526.a:0 "This is a great idea."
 ukraine.526.b:0 "Should dissuade him."
 ukraine.527.t:0 "Renaming of Donetsk"
 ukraine.527.d:0 "From the workers' collectives of Donetsk, a proposal was received to rename the city in honor of our beloved leader Nikita Khrushchev. Donetsk residents remember how he once worked in local mines and fought for the power of workers and peasants in the Donbass, and as the leader of Soviet Ukraine, he actively contributed to the development of the city and the entire region. Should the will of the people be followed in this case?"
 ukraine.527.a:0 "Yes, rename."
 ukraine.527.b:0 "Our general secretary is too modest for this." 
 ukraine.528.t:0 "Nationalist referendum"
 ukraine.528.d:0 "АThe active participation of Dmytro Dontsov in the public life of the country has led to a significant expansion of the electoral base of Ukrainian nationalists. The OUN began to make marches across the country on an unprecedented scale, and the apogee of these actions was the People's Assembly organized in Kyiv, whose participants demanded that Yevhen Konovalets be appointed head of government. The hetman was forced to make these concessions, finally giving executive power to the nationalists. Konovalets did not waste time and, under the pretext of fighting the red threat, announced a referendum, which was supposed to give the head of government emergency powers and limit the activities of most political parties. Thanks to the mobilization of his electorate and the monopoly on violence, Konovalets achieved an impressive result in this declaration of will."
 ukraine.528.a:0 "Finally, we can cast off all bonds..."
 ukraine.529.t:0 "Democratic referendum"
 ukraine.529.d:0 "Pavlo Skoropadskyi finally began to fulfill the old promises to share his power. He appointed Kost Levytsky as the head of the parliamentary group for the development of a new constitution, who was able to lobby for a very progressive project with a division of power between different branches and effective parliamentarism. Under pressure from the ever-increasing democratic opposition, the hetman brought the question of the constitution to an all-Ukrainian referendum, where it received unequivocal approval from Ukrainian citizens. In the parliamentary elections that followed, most of the seats in the State Rada were taken by democratic candidates, who have so far split into many factions. Skoropadsky and his SRS lost all power in the country."
 ukraine.529.a:0 "Only the people will be the source of power in Ukraine."
 ukraine.530.t:0 "Communist referendum"
 ukraine.530.d:0 "Recently, communist ideas have begun to gain popularity among the poor Ukrainian citizens, who feel left out under the Hetmanate, which relies on large landowners. This was facilitated by the position of the hetman himself, who stopped the persecution of the CPU and its supporters, and even attracted one of the communist leaders, Mykola Skrypnyk, as his adviser. Perhaps Skoropadsky thus tried to reorient his policy towards the East, or, tired of fighting the Reds, he decided to lead the socialist wave. But all this only led to a series of large-scale demonstrations by peasants and strikes by workers, who demanded that the hetman, who had sat in his chair, finally give power into the hands of the common people. Hoping to get a vote of approval, Skoropadskyi submitted to a national referendum the question of his future stay at the head of the state, where he lost miserably. Realizing that among the people he had not enjoyed his former popularity for a long time, the hetman resigned as head of state and transferred power to the interim government, where many red figures made their way, quickly orienting themselves in the situation and filling the vacuum of power."
 ukraine.530.a:0 "The interests of the working people will come first."
 carpathian.1.t:0 "The choice of the regional government"
 carpathian.1.d:0 "The first government of the autonomy under the governance of Andriy Brodiy has a rather shaky position, moreover, the central government accuses him of spying for a foreign state. In words, however, Brodiy at the moment consistently stands for the preservation and strengthening of autonomy, without sharp steps in one direction or another. The most obvious competitor of the current leader: Avgustin Voloshin, the leader of the Ukrainophiles and a well-known public figure. On the other hand, Stephan Fentsik, the leader of the Rusyns National Autonomous Party, advocates joining Hungary on the rights of broad autonomy for local Rusyns."
 carpathian.1.a:0 "Brodiy can be trusted further."

 carpathian.5.t:0 "Resistance to the occupation"
 carpathian.5.d:0 "[CUA.GetName], Unlike the central government, is preparing for the armed resistance to our occupation.

 carpathian.10.d:0 "In connection with the final cessation of the existence of Czechoslovakia, Hungarian troops entered our region to maintain order and support the current course of the regional government.

 carpathian.11.t:0 "Unrest in Subcarpathian Rus"
 carpathian.11.d:0 "Due to the outbreak of the war, the issue of granting broad autonomy to Subcarpathian Rus escalated. Some local politicians are trying to strengthen their positions by speculating on the theme of the federal transformation of our country in order to preserve the unity and consent of all the peoples inhabiting it. Among the population of this region, pro-Ukrainian and pro-Hungarian sentiments are growing, this trend is alarming, however, in the conditions of war, autonomy for Subcarpathian Rus can really muffle separatist speeches for a while and ensure greater loyalty of the Ruthenian population."

 carpathian.12.t:0 "Support for Transcarpathia"
 carpathian.12.d:0 "The pro-Ukrainian government of the autonomous Subcarpathian Rus is asking for military assistance to form local self-defense forces.

It is proposed to rename it to Permsk-on-Amur, after the name of the village of Perm, previously located on the site of the city, which restores historical justice.

However, the Russian Empire is now no less distant for us than the Soviet government, so the Ukrainians of the Green Wedge propose to rename the city to New Kherson in order to perpetuate the connection with Ukraine, and in particular with the Kherson province, where many Ukrainian immigrants to the Far East come from.

 makhno.1.t:0 "Anarchist uprising"
 makhno.1.d:0 "Mass demonstrations and confrontation with the police in the capital turned out to be just a cover for preparing a real armed rebellion! Anarchists organized so-called 'self-defense' detachments in rural communities and labor collectives, which stormed police stations in several large cities in the east of the country, which allowed them to get a lot of firearms, after which they blockaded many military units and seized administrative buildings. In less urbanized regions more loyal to Kyiv, police and internal troops managed to largely stop these attacks. But in other areas, some servicemen of the Ukrainian army, along with their command, began to go over to the side of the armed rebels.\n\n A certain Daniil Terpilo declared himself the leader of the revived Free Territory, who claims that he is the Ataman Zeleny who led rebel detachment against the hetman's power in the war of 1917-1920 and for a long time was considered dead. Now he calls on all those dissatisfied with the new government to unite to overthrow it, whether they are ideological Makhnovist anarchists or simply disadvantaged ordinary citizens, fed up with inequality and oppression from the state. Whether this is a real people's chieftain of the past war or an impostor, but his power during the new civil war is recognized by all the main Makhnovist leaders who make up the backbone of the rebels. It will be a war for the preservation of Ukrainian statehood, because the rebels plan to reach Kyiv and completely eliminate the main state institutions, plunging the country into anarchic chaos."

 makhno.2.t:0 "All-Ukrainian Congress of Peasants, Workers and Rebels"
 makhno.2.d:0 "At the last All-Ukrainian Congress of Peasants, Workers and Insurgents, delegates from all over the country elected a permanent composition of the Military Revolutionary Council, whose tasks will include coordinating foreign policy and defense. The candidacy of the chairman of this Council caused great disagreement among the participants of the congress. The self-appointed leader [DKR.GetLeader] refused to continue to bear any responsibility for the country and the people, resigned all powers and remained only the commander of the Black Army. Thus, the most obvious candidate disappeared, and the sympathies of the majority of the delegates were won by two other candidates who interpret the ideological heritage of the Makhnovshchina in quite different ways.\n\nNestor Makhno himself positioned himself as a 'anarchist-communist of the Bakunin-Kropotkin persuasion', which in itself is rather contradictory wording. One of the main ideologists of the Makhnovist movement, Pyotr Arshinov, believes that Ukraine is only a seed from which the world anarcho-communist revolution will grow in the future, and any national features will have to die out in the very near future. His main opponent, Makhno`s closest associate and head of his headquarters in the last war, Viktor Belash, defines the Makhnovist movement as a phenomenon of the Ukrainian people, who have always disliked power and strived for freedom. Belash believes that Nestor Makhno was striving specifically to liberate Ukrainian workers and peasants from the foreign yoke, all other tasks were always secondary.\n\nIf domestic policy does not cause major disagreements now, then the ideological foundations of foreign policy are splitting the congress participants. It is necessary to decide whose position is closer for the majority of delegates, Arshinov`s left bias or Belash`s right bias, and who will thus take the chair. "

 makhno.3.d:0 "Our civilian representatives, who had previously collaborated with the Bolsheviks, used their connections to get help from the Soviet Union, which clearly never sympathized with the current and past government of Ukraine. The People's Commissar of Defense of the USSR conveys his best wishes and notes that quite by accident a batch of unnecessary rifles with ammunition turned up in one of the border warehouses, which can be freely transported for our armed forces. In exchange, the Soviet governance demands not to support the enemies of the Soviet people, as the Hetmanate did earlier, and to further assist in the final resolution of the “white” issue in Crimea. Of course, there is a serious shortage of military equipment in our army assembled from the world, but is it worth trusting the communists, who had already betrayed Old Man Makhno, have they changed much over the past years?"
 makhno.3.a:0 "This temporary allience will do no harm."

 makhno.4.d:0 "Crimea is in our hands, and now the USSR is demanding to fulfill its earlier obligations by transferring control over the peninsula to it. The Soviets have big plans to increase their influence in the region, they need a naval base in Sevastopol and additional airfields. However, the terms of the agreement did not mention territorial claims, perhaps it is enough that the Whites were expelled from the peninsula, and power passed to the local communes. To succumb to this pressure, risking the wrath of the Soviet leader?"
 makhno.4.a:0 "Yes, now is not the time to make new enemies."

 makhno.7.t:0 "Crimean question"
 makhno.7.d:0 "The people won this hard war against the oppressors, but this is not the time to relax! The USSR now demands that the Black Army now break through the Perekop fortifications of the 'whites' and knock them out of the Crimea, so that Soviet power will then be established on the peninsula. This is the price of previously provided assistance in the war, in case of refusal to cooperate, the Bolsheviks themselves may in the future break through a land corridor to the Crimea through our territory."

 makhno.8.t:0 "New threat"

 makhno.10.d:0 "From the workers and soldiers` collectives, many proposals come to perpetuate the memory of Nestro Makhno, who did not live a triplet of anarchism in his homeland. It is proposed to rename the Mother Shop`s Donep`s Trial, which is not too long time to be the current name. The whole surrounding area, accordingly, will be called Makhnovia. Some public figures however indicate that such renaming more in the spirit of old centralized power, in the new society the state should not interfere in such questions."

 makhno.11.t:0 "Jewish pogroms"
 makhno.11.d:0 "As a result of the violation of peace and order in Ukraine, massive Jewish pogroms broke out again throughout the country. Some people tend to blame this people for everything from epidemics to civil war. The army and police, even when they could prevent pogroms, preferred to stay on the sidelines. Undoubtedly, this inappropriate behavior on the part of some military officials should not go unpunished, but is it worth it now to implement harsh disciplinary sanctions against the security forces when they should remain the backbone of the government in an overgrown conflict? But in the absence of such a reaction, many Jews may join the anarchist rebels."

 makhno.12.t:0 "Brigade of Jewish volunteers"
 makhno.12.d:0 "Due to a series of pogroms in Ukraine, Jews began to organize self-defense units and claim the status of a separate series in this civil conflict. Due to the inaction of the Ukrainian authorities, these detachments as a whole turned out to be hostile towards the Ukrainian army. There are so many Jews in our ranks and among the leaders of the movement, but now we have managed to attract to our side a whole unit formed from Jewish self-defense units. The Jewish brigade is ready, together with the Black Army, to repulse the anti-Semitic bourgeois hydra!"

Unfortunately, the enemy turned out to be vigilant and the Makhnovist-anarchist detachments were ambushed, as a result of which they suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat without reaching their goals. We must remember such failures in order not to repeat our mistakes in planning operations in the future."

 makhno.14.t:0 "Raid Result - Success"
 makhno.14.d:0 "Our elite partisan-sabotage units carried out a raid deep into the territory occupied by government troops. They managed to surprise the rear forces of the enemy, disarm them and capture the guarded weapons depots. Unfortunately, on the way back they were overtaken by an enemy mobile detachment of Cossacks, still loyal to the old and new regimes. Part of the booty had to be abandoned, and a detachment of volunteers took an unequal battle in order to delay the enemy and allow the rest to retreat to a safe place. As a result, we suffered quite heavy losses, but the enemy did not get off with scratches either."

 makhno.15.d:0 "Our elite partisan-sabotage units carried out a raid deep into the territory occupied by government troops. They managed to surprise the rear forces of the enemy, disarm them and capture the guarded weapons depots. Also, a separate detachment of saboteurs managed to penetrate one of the Ukrainian weapons factories and caused serious damage to the main workshops, stopping production for a long time. Without letting the enemy come to his senses, our brave guys rushed back in a whirlwind, bringing a lot of trophies that will be used for the benefit of the people's Black Army."

Of course, our glorious Black Army on the western border was one of the main arguments that allowed the Poles to negotiate so reasonably. As a result of this, we undertook to guarantee the integrity of the new borders of Poland and to compensate the Polish government for part of the losses that it will receive as a result of the loss of state property in this territory. This, however, is a fair price for a peaceful reunion with fellow Ukrainians in the West, for our hardworking people it will not be difficult to collect additional voluntary deductions from income to a special fund, which otherwise would have to be directed to military needs."

Of course, every nation that has thrown off the yoke of the government can choose its own future path, we have no right to condemn them for this.

He himself dressed up in an embroidered hussar uniform, put on a sailor cap, had a Caucasian dagger and a saber with him, which he refused to give at the entrance. Having reached the reception room of the main command of the fleet, he took out a revolver from his bosom and began to loudly knock on the table with it, demanding an immediate meeting with the main naval council or its chairman. I had to accept it immediately, where Shchus stated his demand to appoint him admiral of our actively developing fleet. He once served as a sailor in the Tsarist Black Sea Fleet and now believes that since he can distinguish the stern from the keel or the galley from the cockpit, he is more suitable for this position than most milk-suckers who have never smelled gunpowder at sea. \n \n It is not known why this Shchus at his age was drawn to drastically change his field of activity, but something needs to be decided, otherwise he threatens to use his influence among soldiers and officers to achieve his goal, even if this leads to a drop in discipline in the army. Such a brazen stunt in itself should not be encouraged, but perhaps in the Navy, Shchus will finally be able to achieve a state of inner peace and stop making a fuss."

There is already a lot of talk in the army that the goal of the war has been achieved and there is no point in continuing it further. If the Soviet governance is not offered the option of a separate peace with the cession of territories and a border security zone, then it will be very difficult for us to further explain to our soldiers why they should die in the distant taiga."

They executed our peace envoys and announced that they would not accept any offer from us except our surrender. They will be punished for such unheard-of impudence, we must throw this last fragment of the “one and indivisible” empire into the sea in order to eliminate the threat from the south.

 makhno.38.a:0 "We will be a single people."
 makhno.39.t:0 "[From.GetName] makes no concessions"
 makhno.39.d:0 "Negotiations with the [From.GetAdjective] governance ended as soon as they started, [From.GetName] is not going to recognize the right to self-determination for the inhabitants of Transcarpathia and are going to continue to keep this region of free Rusyns by force. We will have to send a call to gather the Black Army soldiers for a new liberation campaign to the West in order to achieve freedom for the next member of the large Ukrainian family."
 makhno.39.a:0 "The Carpathians will not become an obstacle."
# Makhno.40-47 - Hidden Events Without Description
 makhno.48.t:0 "Popular unrest"
 makhno.48.d:0 "Instigated by foreign agents, the lumpen organized coordinated mass demonstrations against the government and strikes. In some places there were even attempts to kindle an armed uprising under anarchist slogans, but our law enforcement forces managed to nip them in the bud. The threat has passed so far, but the state system has received a heavy blow and is clearly shaken, the continuation of such actions can lead to a loss of control over the country."
 makhno.48.a:0 "It should be stopped."
 makhno.49.t:0 "Massive anarchist uprising"
 makhno.49.d:0 "Instigated by foreign agents, the lumpen obtained weapons from somewhere and launched a large-scale armed uprising against the legitimate government throughout the country. The most vile thing here is that traitors were found even in our armed forces, a significant part of which deserted or went over to the side of the rebels. Undoubtedly, this whole infection comes from anarchist Ukraine, which will answer for its crimes."
 makhno.49.a:0 "Let's gather all our strength to suppress the rebels"
 makhno.50.t:0 "Partial failure of the uprising"
 makhno.50.d:0 "Our intelligence work is bearing fruit. Although the next organized uprising with the aim of overthrowing power and establishing anarchy was suppressed and could not grow to a full-fledged revolution, the regime staggered and would not soon recover from the blow. It is worth continuing this activity until stability in the target country collapses completely. Part of the prepared weapons and equipment was not useful and was returned to the warehouses after the end of the operation."
 makhno.50.a:0 "The people will win in the end, let's help them throw off the shackles."
 makhno.51.t:0 "Requirements of the passage"
 makhno.51.d:0 "[From.GetName] requires us to allow unrestricted passage through the straits of Ukrainian and Spanish ships, which constantly ply between these countries after their de facto unification. We don't want to compromise our sovereignty or risk losing our neutrality in any potential conflicts, but we could be attacked from both sides if these anarchists don't get their way."
 makhno.51.a:0 "Going for concessions, we in any case win some time."
 makhno.51.b:0 "No concessions, anarchists will still attack us later."
 makhno.52.t:0 "Turkey is making concessions"
 makhno.52.d:0 "The Turkish governance agreed to make exceptions for any ships from anarchist Spain, agreeing that they now actually belong to the fleet of the Black Sea country, therefore they can freely cross the Black Sea straits, which simply separate the communications of one country. Also, our ships of any type and at any time will now have free access to the Mediterranean, which opens up excellent prospects for the further spread of the anarchist revolution."
 makhno.52.a:0 "Great, we can not be distracted by the Turks yet."
 makhno.53.t:0 "Turks refuse"
 makhno.53.d:0 "The Turkish governance does not want to revise the conditions for our fleet to pass through the Black Sea straits, despite the fact that our territory was actually divided by them after uniting with the Iberian comrades. Our Naval Councils have already worked out a plan for Operation Neptune to seize the Straits by force. If the Turkish governance does not agree to any compromises, then they will have to act by force"
 makhno.53.a:0 "It is better to deliver a quick and powerful blow."
 makhno.53.b:0 "Offer Crimea to Turkey in exchange for temporary concessions."
 makhno.53.c:0 "Offer Crimea to Turkey in exchange for temporary concessions."
 makhno.54.t:0 "A new offer from the Makhnovtsy"
 makhno.54.d:0 "After the failure of the previous round of negotiations with a delegation from anarchist Ukraine, we were offered, as a compromise, to transfer Crimea in exchange for free passage of any warships of the anarchist fleet through the straits. The Crimean peninsula has long been out of the sphere of Turkish influence, now we have the opportunity to return it back and strengthen our positions in the Black Sea."
 makhno.54.a:0 "This is an advantageous offer."
 makhno.54.b:0 "No compromises with anarchists."
 makhno.55.t:0 "Crimea compromise"
 makhno.55.desc.a:0 "After the failure of the previous round of negotiations, the Turkish leader nevertheless agreed to a review of the status of the straits, on the condition that we transfer the territory of the Crimean peninsula to the Turks. It is also difficult for us to make such decisions, countries and regions should not be a bargaining chip in the games of major powers, but at the moment the war with Turkey is not a priority and poses additional threats to the not-yet-most powerful anarchist fleet."
 makhno.55.desc.b:0 "After the failure of the previous round of negotiations, the Turkish leader nevertheless agreed to a review of the status of the straits, on the condition that we transfer the territory of the Crimean peninsula to the Turks. First, of course, you will have to knock out the White Guards from the peninsula, who have thoroughly dug in there, but this is not the most difficult task for the Black Army."
 makhno.55.a:0 "Someday your turn will also come."
 makhno.56.t:0 "[From.GetName] rejects all suggestions"
 makhno.56.d:0 "The Turkish leader is clearly not in the mood to continue negotiations on the status of the straits, noting even the clearly advantageous offer of territorial concessions. This once again proves that no negotiations between anarchist communes and sovereign states can be productive. Only world revolution, only war for liberation!"
 makhno.56.a:0 "There is nothing to do, start preparing the invasion."
 makhno.57.t:0 "Transfer of the Crimea"
 makhno.57.d:0 "Crimea is now under our control, but we will have to give it to Turkey under previously agreed agreements. But now our ships of any type and at any time will have free access to the Mediterranean Sea, which opens up excellent prospects for the further spread of the anarchist revolution."
 makhno.57.a:0 "Get it before we change our minds."
 makhno.58.t:0 "Transfer of the Crimea"
 makhno.58.d:0 "[From.GetName] fulfills the terms of the previously signed agreement and, after the capture of Crimea, transfers control over the peninsula to us in exchange for free military access for their ships to the Black Sea straits."
 makhno.58.a:0 "We are reviving great Turkey."
 makhno.59.t:0 "Delegation from anarchic Ukraine"
 makhno.59.d:0 "We were visited by a delegation of Makhnovist representatives from Ukraine who were interested in deepening cooperation between our peoples, who had thrown off the shackles of statehood. Several interethnic commissions were created and memorandums of cooperation were concluded, in particular, in the field of military production and training of army personnel. We also agreed on mutual protection in case of aggression from any states. Mutually beneficial cooperation will let us become stronger together."
 makhno.59.a:0 "Come again, comrades."
 makhno.60.t:0 "People`s Lustration"
 makhno.60.d:0 "After the change of government and the first democratic transformations in the country, there is an unusual enthusiasm among the masses. People want to get rid of the old heritage and permanently remove from power those who, under the Hetmanate, served the ruling regime and helped build an authoritarian system in Ukraine. Of course, it always seems to ordinary people that the authorities do not respond quickly and effectively enough to the people's aspirations, so in some places there are excesses due to the release of popular anger. So, in one of the provincial cities, a crowd broke into the mayor's office and demanded that the old mayor, who is suspected of corruption and extortion, resign under the threat of physical violence. \n\n Kyiv is also restless, there were cases when the crowd grabbed odious officials and arranged a 'garbage lustration' for them, lowering them into garbage beans, which should symbolize what place is now destined for the old autocrats. The police have not yet intervened in most of the actions that took place, the police chiefs themselves do not want to take on part of the general discontent, therefore they defiantly take the side of the people."
 makhno.60.a:0 "People need just to a little to drop the pairs."
 makhno.61.t:0 "Renaissance of Nabat"
 makhno.61.d:0 "Taking advantage of the sudden liberalization of political life in Ukraine, many figures who were in opposition to the Hetmanate returned to the country. Anarchists are especially active; Belash, Arshinov, Volin and their other leaders, even those who were previously considered dead or missing, are returning en masse to the country or leaving the underground. New anarchist parties and their cells spring up every day in different regions of the country, from Polissya to Donbass.\n\n Recently, the first conference of anarchists took place in Kyiv, where they decided to revive the Nabat Confederation of Anarchist Organizations of Ukraine. This organization included both Makhnovist platformists and figures in opposition to the deceased Batka with their own views on the anarchist structure of society. Nabat should coordinate and lead the people of Ukraine to the complete purification of power and the elimination of the exploitation of one person by another. While the leaders of the anarchists declare that they will use only peaceful means to achieve the desired changes, however, reports have already begun to come to the main police department that some restless Makhnovist leaders are beginning to recruit detachments of young people ready for violent confrontation on the streets of Ukrainian cities."
 makhno.61.a:0 "Political competition is an integral part of democracy."
 makhno.62.t:0 "Nationwide strike"
 makhno.62.d:0 "Anarchists continue their active work and organized the largest industrial strike in recent times. Nabat demands from the authorities a complete lustration of the old administrative apparatus, the adoption of new labor legislation to protect the rights of ordinary workers and the federalization of the country so that any local authorities and councils of workers and peasants have broad self-government.\n\n Many processions and others were also held street actions against the current democratic government. Protesters under the slogans “No to the dictatorship of the USDRP” and “Anarchy is the mother of order” marched along Khreshchatyk and organized a small tent city on the central square of the capital. Serious organizational preparation is observed in the actions of the demonstrators, they are divided into separate detachments with their commanders and subordination to the general leadership. The police have been rather sluggish in their attempts to respond to some of the most significant incidents of disorderly conduct, but the protesters have always been ready to give an organized rebuff to any actions of law enforcement officers. Undoubtedly, if we had time to clear the power structures of disloyal elements, they could show more ardor. In the meantime, the situation across the country is heating up and risks spiraling out of control without decisive action from the government..."
 makhno.62.a:0 "You just need to conduct more negotiations with the leaders of the protest."
 makhno.63.t:0 "Support for the Galician rebels"
 makhno.63.d:0 "In Poland, torn apart by a struggle for power between multi-colored autocratic regimes, an uprising of Ukrainians, prepared by our agents, broke out, who do not want to serve the interests of any Polish parties and leaders, even if they declare concern for the simple peasantry. It is necessary to additionally support the rebels with volunteers and equipment, if they hold out long enough - the Poles will understand that they cannot break the will of the Ukrainians and retreat."
 makhno.63.a:0 "Getting ready to cross the border."
 makhno.64.t:0 "Our future"
 makhno.64.d:0 "The Polish troops could not break the resistance of the armed people of Galicia and Volhynia, so they were forced to retreat. The Poles actually admitted their defeat and focused on further extermination of each other. Now our anarchist commune is faced with the choice of uniting with the fraternal Makhnovist Ukraine or going its own way for the time being. [DKR.GetName] has helped many in our liberation struggle, and its delegates are hinting that they are ready to further seek the unification of Ukraine by any means."
 makhno.64.a:0 "United Ukraine, for the sake of the future of our children."
 makhno.64.b:0 "Let's keep independence, Kyiv is not a decree for us."
 makhno.65.t:0 "Association with Western communes"
 makhno.65.d:0 "The Council of Communes of Galicia and Volhynia has decided to voluntarily become part of our free community. Ukrainians in the West proved that they are worthy of freedom, having fought off (not without our help) from the Polish punishers, and now they will shoulder with us shoulder to shoulder with any challenges that will face a united Free Ukraine in the future."
 makhno.65.a:0 "From the Carpath to Don, Ukrainians will not know oppressions."
 makhno.66.t:0 "Militia issue"
 makhno.66.d:0 "It is now necessary to decide what to do with the various self-defense units and other militias. They consist of people who already have combat experience, but in general they do not meet any military standards. Many public figures have expressed the idea that in fact the anarchist army should consist of self-organized militia units, but the professional military does not really like this idea. The military would like to disband them in order to replenish stocks of weapons for more trained soldiers and improve organization within the army. Some experienced specialists from the militias may well go on to serve in regular units so that their experience is not wasted." 
 makhno.66.a:0 "Leave them in the army."
 makhno.66.a:0 "Disband and appropriate their weapons."
 kuban.1.t:0 "Distribution of collective farm lands"
 kuban.1.d:0 "Heated discussions in the Rada were caused by the issue of distribution of collective farm land. It is clear that it is worth getting rid of the Soviet collective farm heritage, but it is not so easy to return everything as it was, many old owners of the land were killed as a result of the Red Terror or expelled. The Chernomorians insist that the lands should be given out first of all to the victims of repressions and artificial famine of the times of collectivization. The Lineians believe that all Kuban land rightfully belongs to the Cossack class, and it is among the Cossacks that all disputed plots should be distributed. Bych's democrats, maneuvering between these factions, suggest avoiding extremes and trying to approach each specific situation as fairly and balanced as possible, trying first of all to find the rightful owners of the land. The decision on this issue will affect the positions of the factions in the Kuban Rada."
 kuban.1.a:0 "Support the Black Sea project."
 kuban.1.b:0 "Support the linear project."
 kuban.1.c:0 "Support the project of the Democrats."
 kuban.2.t:0 "Language disputes"
 kuban.2.d:0 "The stumbling block that hinders the effective work of the Rada is the issue of the official languages of our region. Chernomorians believe that since the Kuban is part of Ukraine, the language of office work and education should be only Ukrainian, all other languages can be used in those matters that relate to the rights of vulnerable national minorities and indigenous peoples. Lineytsy object to them that the Russian language is as native to many Kubans as Ukrainian, and in general the local “balachka” is a separate dialect that can be used on a par with the “Great Russian” language, but cannot completely serve all state functions alone, Therefore, at least two official languages must be recognized. The centrist democratic faction submitted a third version of the bill, which proposes to recognize the Ukrainian language as the main language of office work in state structures, but gives official status and allows, wherever it is convenient for Kuban citizens, to use Russian or the languages of small indigenous peoples. The decision on this issue will affect the positions of the factions in the Kuban Rada."
 kuban.3.t:0 "Kuban Regional Rada"
 kuban.3.d:0 "The first session of the convened Kuban regional council was solemnly opened, in which the best representatives of the Cossacks and intelligentsia of our region became delegates. A whole choir of bandura players performed before the start of the meetings, performing many Kuban folk songs. The Rada must make many important decisions about how we can eradicate the consequences of the Soviet occupation and where to go next. Several factions immediately took shape in the Rada. The Black Sea people believe that the Kuban is Ukrainian land and without any conditions should become part of a single Ukraine. Lineians cannot afford to dream of the revival of the Russian Empire, but they want to at least preserve the unique feature of this Cossack region, with all its ethnic diversity and complex nuances of interethnic interaction. Rada Chairman Luka Bych and his supporters want to get serious about building a separate democratic republic that will determine its own foreign and domestic policy."
 kuban.3.a:0 "Let`s start the work."
 kuban.4.t:0 "Annexation of Kuban"
 kuban.4.d:0 "A referendum was held in the Kuban, as a result of which the majority voted for joining the region to Ukraine as a full-fledged part of our united country. The local government has already done a good job with the population and the legislation of the region, preparing it for further integration. It remains only to make a final decision on the annexation of the new land."
 kuban.4.a:0 "Welcome to the family."
 kuban.4.b:0 "It`s better to let them remain a separate state."
 kuban.5.t:0 "Day of Unity"
 kuban.5.d:0 "The Ukrainian parliament and the government have finished with all formalities and wires, officially deciding to recognize the results of our last plebiscitis and to take an excellent cubician in the country."
 kuban.5.a:0 "The glory of the Ukrainian Kuban."
 kuban.6.t:0 "Refusal of accession"
 kuban.6.d:0 "[From.GetName] is not yet ready because of the internal problems to make its own parties, so Kuban has remained a separate state."
 kuban.6.a:0 "All the same Kuban is Ukraine."
 kuban.7.t:0 "United Cossackia"
 kuban.7.d:0 "The Kuban Regional Rada adopted a resolution to unite all the Cossack lands of the Don and Kuban into a single Cossackia, as a project designed to protect the interests of a separate Cossack nation. The Don Cossacks also for the most part support this unification project. The decisive word remains with us whether we approve such changes in the boundaries of the Union Territories."
 kuban.7.a:0 "It's time to unite them"
 kuban.7.b:0 "No, we'd rather divide and rule."
 kuban.8.t:0 "Association is agreed"
 kuban.8.d:0 "[From.gotMera] agreed our project of association with the Don, now all the main Cossacks will be under the guidance of one Otaman."
 kuban.8.a:0 "Slavsya Cossackia!"
 kuban.9.t:0 "The association did not receive approval"
 kuban.9.d:0 "[From.GetName] is not going to support our project to create a single Cossack state. Without this support, we can not push the leadership of the Don Cossacks, who are still clinging for their posts."
 kuban.9.a:0 "This is a failure, but the Cossack freemen will not disappear anywhere."
 kuban.10.t:0 "Association of all Cossacks"
 kuban.10.d:0 "[From.GetName] and the Kuban Cossacks promoted the idea of uniting two large Cossack armies: the Kuban and the Don. This idea was in the air and has many supporters on the Don. We cannot go against the will of the people, as well as against the will of the more powerful patrons of the Don army, therefore it is better to try to extract as much benefit as possible from the unification of the fraternal Cossack peoples."
 kuban.10.a:0 "Don and Kuban are united forever!"
 kuban.11.t:0 "Unified command"
 kuban.11.d:0 "With the appointment of the commander-in-chief of the ground forces, there was some hitch. The Black Sea Cossacks are stubbornly trying to promote a veteran of the Ukrainian army, our countryman Vasily Prokhoda, to this position. Among the linears, the candidacy of the experienced White Guard Sergei Ulagay, known for his unsuccessful attempt to liberate the Kuban by large-scale landings from the Crimea, is more popular. Many officers who have previously fought for the Whites will not be happy if Ulagay is not appointed to this position, and may refuse to cooperate in the future. Who is better to choose?"
 kuban.11.a:0 "Vasily Prokhoda will expand the army."
 kuban.11.b:0 "Sergei Ulagai will strengthen the defense."
 kuban.12.t:0 "Successful Ukrainization of Trans-Kuban"
 kuban.12.d:0 "The measures of our regional government to Ukrainize all the Kuban lands turned out to be effective, now education and office work in the Trans-Kuban region have been translated for the most part into the Ukrainian language, the resistance of individual dissatisfied people was successfully overcome without significant upheavals."
 kuban.12.a:0 "Both banks of the Kuban will be Ukrainian."
 kuban.13.t:0 "Adyghe question"
 kuban.13.d:0 ""Local Adyghe Circassians continue to demand the restoration of their autonomy to the level of the Soviet Autonomous Region or even more. They sabotage the implementation of government programs and conscription into the army, they constantly organize civil disobedience actions. One of the informal leaders of the Adyghes, Sultan Klych-Girey, promises in case of implementation the demands of the protesters to recruit volunteers and reinstate the cavalry “Wild Division” in the ranks of the Kuban army, which he himself is ready to lead."
 kuban.13.a:0 "Adyga deserve autonomies on their lands."
 kuban.13.b:0 "Kuban will remain completely unitary."
 kuban.14.t:0 "Renaming Krasnodar"
 kuban.14.d:0 "After the capture of the Kuban, the Bolsheviks renamed her capital to Krasnodar. Now we can fix this historical injustice and return the city to the former name, the Ekaterinodar, under which the city was known most of his history from the very foundation at the end of the interstate century. The power of the red for the past forever failed, and no gifts after it left it could not be, except hunger and destruction."
 kuban.14.a:0 "Excellent idea."
 kuban.15.t:0 "[From.GetName] announces independence"
 kuban.15.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] and the Kuban Territorial Rada, under his leadership, adopted a resolution on the independence of the Kuban. This region for a long time retained broad autonomy, but such a unilateral decision was not agreed with us. Of course, the Kuban people have the right to choose their future, but this does not negate diplomacy. Should this trick be considered a reason for the forceful removal of the rebellious government of the Kuban?"
 kuban.15.a:0 "We will not let them leave."
 kuban.15.b:0 "We don't need the Kuban, let's let go in peace."
 kuban.16.t:0 "[From.GetName] against the Separation"
 kuban.16.d:0 "[From.GetName] has reacted sharply to our declaration of independence and is already preparing to seize our lands by force. We are required to lay down our arms in order to avoid unnecessary casualties among the military and civilian population of the Kuban."
 kuban.16.a:0 "Let's keep our independence."
 kuban.17.t:0 "[From.GetName] don't mind our independence"
 kuban.17.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] reacted quite calmly to the declaration of independence by our republic, saying that he respects the will of the Kuban people. The emergence of an independent Kuban state will undoubtedly strengthen peace and security in the region from the Caucasus to the Don."
 kuban.17.a:0 "Long live an independent Kuban People`s Republic."
 qirimlar.1.t:0 "Unrests in Crimea"
 qirimlar.1.d:0 "Taking advantage of the political crisis and anarchy that broke out in the Crimea, the Crimean Tatars occupied the former Khan's palace in Bakhchisarai and proclaimed the revival of the Crimean People's Republic there. This initiative was supported by the indigenous population throughout the peninsula, the Crimeans hold noisy demonstrations and in some places seize administrative buildings, until the White Guard forces come to their senses and squabble among themselves. The provisional government of the self-proclaimed republic turned to us for recognition and military support. The Crimeans agree to live under a Ukrainian protectorate if we do not interfere in the internal affairs of the peninsula and do not oppress the locals in any way, as the whites do.\n\n This is a great opportunity to resolve the Crimean issue and secure the south of Ukraine, it will be enough to bring to the border with There are several Ukrainian divisions in Crimea, and with the assistance of the Crimean Tatars, we will be able to occupy the peninsula. Even if the whites want to resist, they will not stand in open battle without their fortifications."
 qirimlar.1.a:0 "Recognize them and push the troops to the south."
 qirimlar.1.b:0 "Ignore request."
 qirimlar.2.t:0 "Ukrainian support"
 qirimlar.2.d:0 "The Ukrainian government, after some hesitation, agreed to recognize our republic and establish its own protectorate over it. Ukrainian planes with special operations forces on board are already landing at airfields on the peninsula captured by our supporters, sabotage groups have also landed by sea, which occupy key facilities in the northern part of Crimea. The White forces are confused and are not now offering significant resistance, the defense on the lines near Perekop and Chongar has actually collapsed. Their central government (or what is left of it) is trying frantically to decide on a plan for further action."
 qirimlar.2.a:0 "It is our victory."
 qirimlar.3.t:0 "Stab in the back"
 qirimlar.3.d:0 "The Crimean Tatars rebelled and proclaimed their republic, after which they invited Ukrainian troops to our peninsula. Due to the disunity of the Crimean headquarters, the inaction of our commanders on the ground and the treacherous sabotage of the Tatars, the Ukrainians were able to easily overcome the previously impregnable defenses on the isthmus and occupy the steppe part of Crimea. The enemy is already approaching the southern cities, Sevastopol and Kerch are under threat, it is urgent to decide whether the Russian officers will unite their forces for the last battle or go into exile to avoid unnecessary casualties."
 qirimlar.3.a:0 "Retreat."
 qirimlar.3.b:0 "Fight."
 qirimlar.4.t:0 "Whites retreat"
 qirimlar.4.d:0 "The Russian generals did not dare to fight and defend the cities in the south to the end, the White Guards began to hastily evacuate on their ships. Ukrainian soldiers, to the jubilant exclamations of the Crimeans, occupy city after city without a fight. This landmark event will mark the collapse of the Russian imperial idea and the end of the oppression of indigenous peoples in Crimea, which will return to the rule of its true masters."
 qirimlar.4.a:0 "Crimea will never be Russian again."
 qirimlar.5.t:0 "Second Kurultai"
 qirimlar.5.d:0 "Today, the solemn opening of the session of the second Kurultai took place, which brought together delegates from all over the Crimea, as well as from the Crimean Tatar diaspora abroad. The participants confirmed the powers of the Mejlis under the leadership of Cafer Seydahmet as an interim government until the composition of the permanent Crimean government is determined in the future at the Kurultai. Many delegates are ready to support the transfer of power to the opposition, so the debate over the composition of the Mejlis promises to be heated. It was also immediately decided to return the historical Crimean Tatar names to the Crimean cities.\n\n The Second Kurultai will work until an agreement is reached on the distribution of government posts and the foundations of domestic policy. It was decided to leave more global questions about the place of Crimea and its indigenous peoples in the world for the agenda of the next Kurultai. Some delegates do not agree with this decision, stating that if Crimea becomes independent before the third Kurultai, this will open up great prospects for our country. Like it or not, the future will show."
 qirimlar.5.a:0 "Let's proceed to the formation of a permanent Mejlis."
 qirimlar.6.t:0 "Change government"
 qirimlar.6.d:0 "The second Kurultai voted no confidence in the interim Mejlis of Seydahmet, showing that the influence of the opposition factions is very great. Now the opposition needs to decide which of them will form a new, permanent Mejlis. The main factions are traditionalists and nationalists, whose programs are equally radical compared to the program of the previous government, but even more different from each other. Also, sometimes a faction of communists, who are always ready to try to implement the ideas of Marx-Engels-Lenin, on any grounds, gives a voice."
 qirimlar.6.a:0 "Traditionalists."
 qirimlar.6.b:0 "Nationalists."
 qirimlar.6.c:0 "Communists."
 qirimlar.7.t:0 "Heir of the House of Giray"
 qirimlar.7.d:0 "The House of Giray has long lost power in the Crimea and the issue of the legitimate heir to their throne is quite complicated, no one now makes any irrefutable claims. The representatives of the Mufti managed to get in touch in the USA with the former colonel of the Russian army Sultan Kadir Giray, a descendant of our Gireys who had become Circumscribed, who listened attentively to the proposal and agreed to take this important, albeit rather symbolic, position. Kadir Giray has a rather weak connection with Crimea, but he is a brave soldier and has a certain reputation among Muslim immigrants from the territory of the former Russian Empire. The absence of ties with the Crimean elites even plays into the hands of the Mufti, as it will allow him to continue to retain full power, leaving the khan with the function of a symbol of the unity of the Crimean nation. The Sultan also has a son, Chingiz, to whom in the future it will be possible to calmly transfer the throne."
 qirimlar.7.a:0 "May Allah give wisdom to our new Khan!"
 qirimlar.8.t:0 "Khan's new subjects"
 qirimlar.8.d:0 "Such an interesting guest as prince Nikolai Kudashev, a former tsarist and Wrangel officer, a monarchist poet and just an adventurer, also showed up at the enthronement ceremony of the khan. He stated that, together with a large group of his monarchist supporters who had not yet left the Crimea, he was ready to serve faithfully to the new khan. He promises to form elite cavalry units that will be able to reach Moscow and drive the red usurpers out of the Kremlin. Undoubtedly, Prince Kudashev is pursuing his own and rather unrealistic goals, but for some time now he can serve the benefit of the Crimean Khanate."

 qirimlar.9.a:0 "Understand."
 qirimlar.10.t:0 "Peace with anarchists"
 qirimlar.10.d:0 "Unfortunately, our Crimea was drawn into the civil war that broke out in Ukraine. Anarchist rebels can invade the peninsula at any moment and ravage it with war. Their leaders, in principle, are not against the existence of Crimea as a separate state and offer the Mejlis to conclude a truce, as well as to recognize our independence. Of course, in Kyiv this may be viewed with hostility, but the Ukrainian state already has many problems, so we should not be afraid of a reaction from there, whatever it may be."

 qirimlar.11.d:0 "The Crimean Mejlis declared the independence of the autonomy from Ukraine and concluded a truce with the Makhnovists. This vile betrayal in the midst of the war should not remain without consequences, the autonomy of the Crimea was not given to the Crimean Tatars to play on the side of the enemies of the Ukrainian state. We can immediately declare war on the Crimean rebels, but from a military point of view, this may be a wrong decision, since there are barely enough troops now to counter one threat."
 qirimlar.11.a:0 "War with Crimea."
 qirimlar.11.b:0 "Limit yourself to strong protest."
 qirimlar.12.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuse"
 qirimlar.12.d:0 "The Mejlis did not want to listen to our proposals, its head announced that he was not negotiating with brigands and traitors. Crimean Tatars stubbornly remain loyal to the Kyiv regime, despite the fact that it will not support independence for Crimea, unlike us."
 qirimlar.12.a:0 "So, anarchy will come to Crimea."
 qirimlar.13.t:0 "Public Enemies"
 qirimlar.13.d:0 "The case of the transfer of funds in gold abroad, presumably being the withdrawal of capital by local Wrangelites to a safer place from their point of view, came to the consideration of the Extraordinary Commission. Some major official from the executive departments of the Mejlis is definitely involved in this case, suspicions fell on two people: Veli Ibraimov and Ablyakim Gafarov. The first one is a public figure with great experience, he was a member of the Milli Firka party during the civil war, and now he must deal with the issues of overcoming the economic crisis and the threat of famine. The second is a younger and more promising engineer who should be responsible for the development of the manufacturing industry in Crimea, especially the military one. Undoubtedly, we must ruthlessly eradicate this infection, arrange a show trial for one of them and deprive them of all posts and prospects, so that everyone else would be reluctant to associate with counter-revolutionary capitalist elements in any way."
 qirimlar.13.a:0 "Blame Ibraimov."
 qirimlar.13.b:0 "Blame Gafarov."
 qirimlar.14.t:0 "Feat of the Crimean Ace"
 qirimlar.14.d:0 "Today, Amet-khan Sultan, the best pilot of the Crimean Air Force, who distinguished himself in recent air battles, received a well-deserved award and promotion. His fighter aviation regiment is part of the Crimean air defense and actively participated in the interception of enemy bombers. In one of these sorties, Amet-khan won his most spectacular aerial victory. Having used up all the ammunition in the attacks, he rammed an enemy bomber on his fighter, hitting him with the left plane from below. Upon impact, his plane got stuck in a burning enemy plane, but our hero managed to get out of the cockpit and use a parachute for a successful rescue. Undoubtedly, this air ram will be studied by subsequent generations of Crimean pilots."
 qirimlar.14.a:0 "Long life and new glorious victories to the hero."
 qirimlar.15.t:0 "Alliance with Crimea"
 qirimlar.15.d:0 "The Crimean government offers us to conclude a union treaty between the two countries, or at least give guarantees of independence for the revived Crimean state. Crimea has long been closely connected with Turkey and now wants to fall under our protection again. This will significantly strengthen our positions on the Black Sea, but some other countries may also lay claim to the territory of the peninsula."
 qirimlar.15.a:0 "Agree."
 qirimlar.15.b:0 "Refuse."
 qirimlar.16.t:0 "[From.GetName] agree"
 qirimlar.16.d:0 "[From.GetName] agrees to strengthen the bonds between our two kindred nations and take [CRI.GetName] under his wing again. Agreements with security guarantees will soon be signed in Istanbul. The treaty will contribute to peace and prosperity in the entire Black Sea region, even if some of our neighbors do not like it."
 qirimlar.16.a:0 "Together we are not afraid of any enemies."
 qirimlar.17.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuse"
 qirimlar.17.d:0 "[From.GetName] ignores our attempts to get closer and offer an alliance treaty. Our ambassador could not achieve anything in such conditions. Probably, the Turks now have too many internal problems of their own to engage in geopolitics."
 qirimlar.17.a:0 "The Crimean army itself can protect the peninsula."
 qirimlar.18.t:0 "Turkey demand Crimea"
 qirimlar.18.d:0 "The leaders of Turkey and Crimea held a meeting in Istanbul, despite the fact that the Crimean delegation did not coordinate anything with our government. As a result of the negotiations, it was announced that Crimea, according to the will of the Crimean people, which is represented by the Mejlis, will henceforth be under the protection of the Turkish army and navy. This is an outrageous unilateral violation of previous agreements, according to which the peninsula should be under our guardianship. How can we respond to this initiative?"
 qirimlar.18.a:0 "Since this is the will of the Crimean people, we will yield."
 qirimlar.18.b:0 "Crimea is under our protection and we will fight for it."
 qirimlar.19.t:0 "Crimea is now in our sphere of influence"
 qirimlar.19.d:0 "As a result of long and difficult negotiations, our diplomats succeeded in ensuring that the Crimean peninsula with its Muslim population came under our protectorate. No one wanted to get involved with the Turkish armed forces, especially since the Crimean Mejlis in these negotiations acted in accordance with the decisions of the legitimate Kurultai."
 qirimlar.19.a:0 "It is better for the Crimeans to be together with the Turks again."
 qirimlar.20.t:0 "Crimean crisis"
 qirimlar.20.d:0 "A serious diplomatic crisis is growing around Crimea, which could develop into a military crisis. Recently, on the initiative of the Crimean Mejlis, negotiations have been held that allow the deployment of Turkish troops on the territory of this peninsula in order to ensure its protection. [From.GetName] does not want to lose his control over it, however, and brings his divisions to the isthmus in order to defeat the legitimate government of Crimea if necessary and completely occupy the territory. We must act quickly and decisively if we want to become a great power again and control the Black Sea."
 qirimlar.20.a:0 "We are ready to fight for the Crimea."
 qirimlar.20.b:0 "It is better not to bring the matter to war and retreat for now."
 qirimlar.21.t:0 "Our patrons"
 qirimlar.21.d:0 "[From.GetName] now he takes under his protection the Crimea and the peoples inhabiting it, who expressed their will at the meeting of the third Kurultai. No one dares to object to this and it will be better for everyone."
 qirimlar.21.a:0 "This is a big victory for the Mejlis."
 qirimlar.22.t:0 "War!"
 qirimlar.22.d:0 "We did not succeed in peacefully implementing all the decisions of the last Kurultai, but [From.GetName] is ready to fight for the Crimea. [From.GetAdjective] army is ready to land to help the Crimean people defend their vision of the future."
 qirimlar.22.a:0 "The war has begun, we will defend the Crimea."
 qirimlar.23.t:0 "[From.GetName] be careful"
 qirimlar.23.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] suddenly abandoned previous agreements, declaring that the agreement on the protectorate over the Crimea is declarative and cannot yet be implemented. Perhaps this is for the best, because otherwise a full-scale war could break out, which would bring death and destruction to the Crimea."
 qirimlar.23.a:0 "[From.GetName] still remains a strategic partner."
 qirimlar.23.b:0 "Crimea will stay where it is."
 qirimlar.24.t:0 "[From.GetName] wants to join the Union"
 qirimlar.24.d:0 "The newly independent Crimean proletariat expressed a desire to become part of the Soviet state as a separate Soviet republic. At the same time, the Crimean Mejlis plans to maintain its separate armed forces for the defense of the peninsula. In any case, the sphere of Soviet influence will seriously expand with the entry of Crimea into the Union, and the Red Fleet will receive new convenient bases on the Black Sea."
 qirimlar.24.a:0 "Agree to accept Crimea on its terms."
 qirimlar.24.b:0 "No, we do not need such comrades."
 qirimlar.25.t:0 "[From.GetName] signs an agreement"
 qirimlar.25.d:0 "[From.GetName] agreed to accept our socialist state as part of the Union. Now our republic will be under the reliable protection of the Red Army, like all other Soviet republics, but at the same time it will retain significant internal independence."
 qirimlar.25.a:0 "Rise up, you damned, hungry, oppressed people!"
 qirimlar.26.t:0 "[From.GetName] withdraws from the agreement"
 qirimlar.26.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] does not want to accept our republic into the Union. Probably, the Soviet governance has other plans for the peninsula, including purely predatory ones."
 qirimlar.26.a:0 "We need to be doubly alert now, dangers are everywhere."
 qirimlar.27.t:0 "[From.GetName] wants to join the Union"
 qirimlar.27.d:0 "The Crimean Mejlis made the final decision unilaterally, without the consent of its central authorities, to join the USSR. Now our support is required so that this decision, if necessary, is backed up by the military might of the Red Army."
 qirimlar.27.a:0 "Support comrades, Crimea is our land."
 qirimlar.27.b:0 "Do not get involved in such adventures."
 qirimlar.28.t:0 "[From.GetName] support us"
 qirimlar.28.d:0 "The Soviet government is ready to fight for the entry of Crimea into the Union, even if this leads to a new full-scale war in Europe. Let us officially announce this decision and wait for the reaction of our current overlord."
 qirimlar.28.a:0 "Proletarians of the Crimea and the USSR, unite!"
 qirimlar.29.t:0 "Separatism in Crimea"
 qirimlar.29.d:0 "The Crimean Mejlis declared its sovereignty and unilaterally decided to become part of the USSR. This decision was already publicly supported by the Soviet leader, who announced the imminent introduction of Red Army units to the peninsula, threatening all "foreign" troops that remained there with destruction. This is a vile betrayal on the part of the Crimean Tatars, we now have to decide whether it is worth starting a war with the entire Bolshevik horde for this peninsula."
 qirimlar.29.a:0 "Retreat."
 qirimlar.29.b:0 "Fight."
 qirimlar.30.t:0 "[From.GetName] will not retreat"
 qirimlar.30.d:0 "[From.GetName] is not going to put up with our interference in Crimean affairs and is not limited only to diplomatic protests. [From.GetAdjective] The government has declared the members of the Mejlis traitors and issued an ultimatum to reverse previous decisions, and their army is preparing to fight for the peninsula, as well as in all other potential military theaters."
 qirimlar.30.a:0 "The decision is made and it's too late to retreat."
 qirimlar.31.t:0 "Territorial claims of Crimea"
 qirimlar.31.d:0 "The Crimean republican government asks us to assist in resolving territorial disputes regarding Northern Taurida, which is adjacent to the Crimean peninsula. Crimea claims this territory, it has long been part of the Crimean Khanate, and then it was also closely connected with the peninsula. We can put pressure on the current owner of this land if we want to support the Crimean people. Moreover, this claim can be useful as a reason for even greater expansion of the borders of the proletarian state."
 qirimlar.31.a:0 "Support the Crimea and announce ultimatum."
 qirimlar.31.b:0 "No, because of such a trifle, it is not worth spoiling relations with anyone."
 qirimlar.32.t:0 "Soviet ultimatum"
 qirimlar.32.d:0 "[From.GetName], supporting his petty Crimean puppet, made claims to a part of our Northern Black Sea region together with Kherson and ultimatum demands that it be transferred to the Soviet Crimea. In case of refusal, the Red Army will be ready to invade our country and take by force everything that the Soviet leader wants."
 qirimlar.32.a:0 "Accept ultimatum."
 qirimlar.32.b:0 "Refuse ultimatum."
 qirimlar.33.t:0 "[From.GetName] did not support the Crimean initiative"
 qirimlar.33.d:0 "Our claims to Northern Taurida did not find support from the Soviet governance, the delegation returned with nothing from the Soviet capital. This ignorance of local issues on the part of the center suggests that our Mejlis needs to show more independence in all matters."
 qirimlar.33.a:0 "It would be better if our proposal was accepted."
 qirimlar.34.t:0 "[From.GetName] cede Kherson"
 qirimlar.34.d:0 "[From.GetName] under pressure from the Soviet governance agrees to cede Northern Tavria and Kherson to us. Undoubtedly, the whole of Taurida will only benefit from this, thanks to the strengthening of ties with the mainland, Crimea will develop more quickly and harmoniously."
 qirimlar.34.a:0 "It's good that everything went peacefully."
 qirimlar.35.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuse ultimatum"
 qirimlar.35.d:0 "[From.GetName] refuses to peacefully cede the Kherson region to the Crimea. This gives us a reason to take him (and maybe not only him) by force in order to restore historical justice and unite the scattered lands of the Crimean people."
 qirimlar.35.a:0 "Our hands are now free."
 qirimlar.36.t:0 "Request for revision of boundaries"
 qirimlar.36.d:0 "The Crimean republican government asks to consider the issue of revising the borders of the republics. If the Kherson region were included in the Crimean Republic, this would greatly contribute to the development of the Crimea, and would also make it possible to better use the water resources of the Dnieper. In addition, this region is historically and culturally strongly connected with the Crimea."
 qirimlar.36.a:0 "Agree, anyway, it is essentially all one country."
 qirimlar.36.b:0 "This offer is of no interest."
 qirimlar.37.t:0 "[From.GetName] transfer Kherson"
 qirimlar.37.d:0 "The capital reacted favorably to the idea of transferring Kherson to us. This decision will undoubtedly improve the economic situation in the region and strengthen the friendship of the peoples in the Union."
 qirimlar.37.a:0 "Kherson and Crimea will be together forever."
 qirimlar.38.t:0 "Crimea claims Kherson"
 qirimlar.38.d:0 "A territorial dispute has arisen between the two socialist republics that requires our attention. Crimea claims to be part of Northern Taurida, which is adjacent to the Crimean peninsula. This territory has long been part of the Crimean Khanate, and then was also closely connected with the peninsula."
 qirimlar.38.a:0 "Support Crimea."
 qirimlar.38.b:0 "Nothing needs to be changed there, these claims are ridiculous."
 qirimlar.39.t:0 "[From.GetName] demands to transfer Kherson"
 qirimlar.39.d:0 "The Crimean government for many months encouraged the Soviet governance to revise the border along Perekop in their favor and even achieved success in this matter. Now [From.GetLeader] is demanding that we "voluntarily" transfer the Black Sea region centered in Kherson to the Crimean Republic. Allegedly, this will be fair and better for all working citizens. If we go against the allied center, then this will mean a break in allied relations with the possible displacement of our government by force in the future."
 qirimlar.39.a:0 "Better not to refuse an ally."
 qirimlar.39.b:0 "Refuse, this alliance is not worth a penny, since it leads to the loss of land."
 qirimlar.40.t:0 "[From.GetName] doesn't accept our decision"
 qirimlar.40.d:0 "[From.GetAdjective] the government refuses to follow the recommendations from the center and does not resolutely refuse to transfer Kherson to the Crimea. Such behavior is not what we expect from a fraternal socialist state. In the new world of the victorious proletariat, there will be no place for clinging to some separate territories, because the whole world will be open for work and leisure of the working people. We will crush these hidden reactionaries so that others will be repulsed."
 qirimlar.40.a:0 "Now [From.GetName] is not our ally, but an enemy."
 qirimlar.41.t:0 "Third Kurultai"
 qirimlar.41.d:0 "The past third Kurultai recorded great successes in building the Crimean state, which the people of Crimea were able to achieve under the leadership of the current Mejlis. The Crimean Tatars, Karaites, Krymchaks and other peoples, after a long stay under foreign domination, were able not only to achieve the creation of their national autonomy, but also lead it eventually to complete independence. Such a rapid breakthrough allowed many Kurultai delegates to say that in the future it would be possible to recreate the Crimean state within the old borders of the Crimean Khanate. To some, this may seem like an absolutely unrealistic project, but a few years ago, few could have imagined that Crimea would break anchor and go on an independent voyage under the leadership of a captain from the local people. In any case, now the Kurultai is ready to support even the most ambitious undertakings of the Mejlis."
 qirimlar.41.a:0 "Now we have many different paths in front of us."
 qirimlar.42.t:0 "Choosing five-year plan"
 qirimlar.42.d:0 "The Mejlis developed four five-year plans for the development of the national economy following the Soviet model. The fulfillment of all these plans will fundamentally transform Crimea and allow the Crimeans, along with other peoples, to enter a bright communist future. The order of implementation of the plans is still a controversial issue, now it is necessary to choose a five-year plan for execution from those that remain:"
 qirimlar.42.a:0 "Plan for the development of means of production."
 qirimlar.42.b:0 "Plan for the expansion of military production."
 qirimlar.42.c:0 "Plan for the development of science and education."
 qirimlar.42.e:0 "Plan for improving the welfare of citizens."
 qirimlar.43.t:0 "[From.GetName] asking for protection and support"
 qirimlar.43.d:0 "The Crimean Mejlis turned to us with a proposal to sign a union treaty, which, in particular, will provide for the protection of Crimea by the Ukrainian army in the event of external aggression. Recently, our relations with the Crimea have been quite fruitful and friendly, having taken the defense of the peninsula under guardianship, in the event of a large-scale war we would immediately occupy more reliable positions on the Black Sea. But is it worth taking the extra risks because of it?"
 qirimlar.43.a:0 "Agree."
 qirimlar.43.b:0 "Refuse."
 qirimlar.44.t:0 "[From.GetName] signs agreement"
 qirimlar.44.d:0 "Ukraine agreed to strengthen friendly relations between our peoples, now [From.GetName] officially guarantees the independence and inviolability of the borders of our Crimean state. We are now also giving the Ukrainian army full military access to deploy on the peninsula."
 qirimlar.44.a:0 "Now our independence is secure."
 qirimlar.45.t:0 "[From.GetName] does not show interest in negotiations"
 qirimlar.45.d:0 "[From.GetName] has not yet shown any significant interest in strengthening friendship and cooperation between our peoples. Things did not move beyond standard diplomatic statements about respect for the right of the Crimean peoples to self-determination and the aspirations of the Ukrainian people for peace, our delegation had to return with nothing."
 qirimlar.45.a:0 "They probably have too many problems."
 qirimlar.46.t:0 "[From.GetName] asks to support the Crimean independence"
 qirimlar.46.d:0 "The Crimean Mejlis asked us to support the declaration of independence by Crimea and to provide security guarantees for the Crimean people. [From.GetName] has long been planning to break off relations with the metropoly and become an independent state, but it will be difficult for him to resist possible forceful opposition on his own. Once the Crimean Tatars supported the Khmelnytsky uprising, although they were not very reliable allies, now they have come to us to get support from the Ukrainian people. We, of course, will benefit from the retreat of another power from our southern borders, but if something happens, we will have to fight beyond these borders later."
 qirimlar.46.a:0 "Give guarantees."
 qirimlar.46.b:0 "No, we don't need a war."
 qirimlar.47.t:0 "[From.GetName] support us"
 qirimlar.47.d:0 "[From.GetAdjective] government agreed to guarantee our independence and protect the Crimea if the metropolis does not approve the declaration of independence and tries to overthrow the current Mejlis. Undoubtedly, the Ukrainian people will become the best friend of the Crimean people, we all know very well what price one has to pay for freedom."
 qirimlar.47.a:0 "Let's declare the full independence of Crimea."
 qirimlar.48.t:0 "Defiance in Crimea"
 qirimlar.48.d:0 "The Crimean Mejlis somehow secured Ukrainian support and declared the independence of the Crimean state. A certain referendum will be held to approve this decision, but we know what results will be drawn in such a situation. We immediately made a decision about the illegitimacy of the Mejlis in Crimea, but this will not change anything either. [From.GetName] is preparing for a possible defense, Ukrainian troops will also come to their aid. All that remained was the option of a lightning-fast military campaign to take control of the peninsula and take defensive lines in the north."
 qirimlar.48.a:0 "We will not cede Crimea to anyone."
 qirimlar.48.b:0 "We can't afford to start a big war now."
 qirimlar.49.t:0 "Ukrainian autonomy"
 qirimlar.49.d:0 "The Ukrainian government proposes to organize a Ukrainian cultural autonomy in the north of the peninsula, where quite a lot of Ukrainian peasants live. Kyiv itself will be engaged in this case in the organization of training and the activities of the media in this territory. Undoubtedly, we respect the Ukrainian minority and additional autonomy for it will contribute to strengthening peace and tranquility in Crimea, but does this not contradict the policy of non-interference in our internal affairs?"
 qirimlar.49.a:0 "That would be a reasonable concession."
 qirimlar.49.b:0 "We will not allow anyone to interfere, Crimea must be unitary."
 qirimlar.50.t:0 "Crimean uprising"
 qirimlar.50.d:0 "In the autumn of 1936, in the Crimea, with the support of the Ukrainian army, an uprising of the Crimean Tatars took place, as a result of which the Crimean People's Republic was revived. At the Kurultai that passed after that, a government was formed that led the Crimea along its own path..."
 qirimlar.50.a:0 "Let's see what kind of government is there."
 qirimlar.51.t:0 "Choice government"
 qirimlar.51.d:0 "Four political forces were ready to form a Mejlis to govern Crimea: Milli Firka Democrats, Pan-Turkist Nationalists, Monarchist Traditionalists, and Pro-Soviet Communists. Kurultai supported the next force:"
 qirimlar.51.a:0 "Democrats."
 qirimlar.51.b:0 "Nationalists."
 qirimlar.51.c:0 "Traditionalists."
 qirimlar.51.e:0 "Communists."
 qirimlar.52.t:0 "Demolition of fortifications"
 qirimlar.52.d:0 "[UKR.GetName] recommends demolishing the fortifications in the north of the peninsula, left over from the whites, since at present they have already lost their relevance. Without them, communication with the border Ukrainian regions will be improved, and when dismantling the bunkers, you can get a lot more suitable building materials for any civilian infrastructure in the northern steppe."
 qirimlar.52.a:0 "It's a good idea."
 qirimlar.52.b:0 "No need."
 qirimlar.53.t:0 "Secret negotiations with Crimea"
 qirimlar.53.d:0 "[From.GetName] wants to conclude a pact with us, involving a joint military campaign against Russia. It is assumed that the Crimean troops will land in the Kuban and thus divert the enemy army, and we will strike at the Caucasian region. The Crimean Mejlis does not mind if Turkey takes revenge on the Russians for previous defeats and dominates the Transcaucasus, but for this we will first have to overthrow the ears on clay feet there."
 qirimlar.53.a:0 "We are ready for war together with the brotherly people."
 qirimlar.53.b:0 "Perhaps we will provide them with some support, but we are not ready for war."
 qirimlar.53.c:0 "We are not interested in this adventure."
 qirimlar.54.t:0 "[From.GetName] agree"
 qirimlar.54.d:0 "Before the possible start of a new military campaign to return the eastern territories, our delegation visited Turkey in order to win her over to our side in this enterprise. Ankara enthusiastically accepted this proposal and is ready to support us in the war by opening a second front in the Caucasus."
 qirimlar.54.a:0 "Together we will sweep our enemies into the Caspian Sea."
 qirimlar.55.t:0 "[From.GetName] is cautious"
 qirimlar.55.d:0 "Before the possible start of a new military campaign to return the eastern territories, our delegation visited Turkey in order to win her over to our side in this enterprise. Unfortunately, the Turks are not ready for an open war with a formidable enemy, but they promised to provide us with indirect support, as they always took care of the people of Crimea."
 qirimlar.55.a:0 "This is some help."
 qirimlar.56.t:0 "[From.GetName] rejects the offer"
 qirimlar.56.d:0 "Before the possible start of a new military campaign to return the eastern territories, our delegation visited Turkey in order to win her over to our side in this enterprise. The Turkish government, however, showed no interest in the matter, citing the many problems within the country that it had yet to resolve before engaging in such major wars."
 qirimlar.56.a:0 "Maybe they're just afraid?"
 qirimlar.57.t:0 "Request from Crimea"
 qirimlar.57.d:0 "Crimean leader [From.GetLeader] asks us to approve for Crimean warships unlimited passage through our straits, as well as to give them the right to stay in Turkish ports on the Mediterranean Sea in order to increase their range capabilities."
 qirimlar.57.a:0 "Agree."
 qirimlar.57.b:0 "Decline."
 qirimlar.58.t:0 "Turkey opens access to the Mediterranean Sea"
 qirimlar.58.d:0 "The Turkish government has shown a truly friendly position towards the Crimean people and has opened unlimited access to the Black Sea straits for our fleet. Now our ships can freely pass at least to the Mediterranean Sea."
 qirimlar.58.a:0 "This will expand our possibilities."
 qirimlar.59.t:0 "Turkey does not make concessions"
 qirimlar.59.d:0 "The Turkish government does not want to make an exception for anyone in the rules for using the Black Sea straits, including for the fraternal Muslim people. This means that in wartime we will not be able to operate as a navy beyond the Black Sea."
 qirimlar.59.a:0 "We remain locked in coastal waters."
 qirimlar.60.t:0 "Secret negotiations with Crimea"
 qirimlar.60.d:0 "[From.GetName], acting through our local Lipki Tatars, wants to conclude a pact with us, involving a joint military campaign against Ukraine. It is no secret that the Poles and Ukrainians in the past and present have enough conflict points that can easily escalate into a war. The Crimean leader proposes to attack Ukraine from two sides, we are from the west, they are from the south in the Black Sea steppes. Undoubtedly, the Crimeans are driven by the desire to restore the borders of the ancient Crimean Khanate, but are we that ambitious too?"
 qirimlar.60.a:0 "It's high time to liquidate the Ukrainian threat."
 qirimlar.60.b:0 "Perhaps we will provide them with some support, but we are not ready for war."
 qirimlar.60.c:0 "We are not interested in this adventure."
 qirimlar.61.t:0 "[From.GetName] agree"
 qirimlar.61.d:0 "Before the possible start of a new military campaign for the return of the Northern Black Sea region, we held negotiations with Poland in order to win her over to our side in this enterprise. The Poles, it seems, also planned to strike at Ukraine, so they fully accepted the opportunity to act as a united front in order to turn the balance of power in the region."
 qirimlar.61.a:0 "Forward!"
 qirimlar.62.t:0 "[From.GetName] is cautious"
 qirimlar.62.d:0 "Before the possible start of a new military campaign for the return of the Northern Black Sea region, we held negotiations with Poland in order to win her over to our side in this enterprise. [From.GetName] on the one hand is interested in any weakening of Ukraine, but the Poles themselves do not plan to do anything with their own hands, so they only promised our negotiators to provide volunteers and equipment to help in our war against Ukraine if possible."
 qirimlar.62.a:0 "This is some help."
 qirimlar.63.t:0 "[From.GetName] rejects the offer"
 qirimlar.63.d:0 "Before the possible start of a new military campaign for the return of the Northern Black Sea region, we held negotiations with Poland in order to win her over to our side in this enterprise. Unfortunately, [From.GetLeader] does not perceive us as a strong ally and is not going to discuss any joint military plans with us."
 qirimlar.63.a:0 "Maybe they're just afraid?"
 qirimlar.64.t:0 "New Kurultai"
 qirimlar.64.d:0 "In the Crimean Tatar autonomy, they are preparing for the next Kurultai, at which, according to our information, questions regarding how loyal the indigenous inhabitants of Crimea should remain to the Ukrainian authorities will be discussed. In such a situation, it would be good to give some attention to the problems of the peninsula before this people's congress so that its population does not get the impression that Kyiv is indifferent to local issues."
 qirimlar.64.a:0 "Let's try to do something."
 qirimlar.65.t:0 "Economic aid"
 qirimlar.65.d:0 "[From.GetName] has recently been actively developing the industry on the peninsula to the detriment of its own development. Thanks to funds allocated from the central budget, several civilian industrial enterprises were opened in the north of Crimea, which will give a significant impetus to the further development of even purely agricultural areas."
 qirimlar.65.a:0 "Ukrainian aid will benefit the peoples of Crimea."
 qirimlar.66.t:0 "Military training"
 qirimlar.66.d:0 "The Ukrainian army suddenly conducted large-scale exercises of ground forces on our peninsula, working out a hypothetical version of the enemy’s naval invasion. Crimean units also took part in the exercises, which enriched them with new experience."
 qirimlar.66.a:0 "Together with the Ukrainian army, we will create a strong defense."
