The Hetmanate regime has since continued to control the life of the country, keeping under the supervision of any likely opponents of Skoropadsky. \n\nNow the Ukrainian state is experiencing a sluggish economic and political crisis, a way out of which has yet to be found."

 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Divided between three empires for many centuries, Poland has finally regained its independence. But now she is in a precarious position. \n\nTo the east of it is the Soviet Union, which has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war, as well as the Ukrainian state, which claims the lands of the ZUNR. \n\nTo the west, the German Fuhrer Adolf Hitler, openly declaring a desire to expand "living space" and that the former German territories, now part of Poland, will be the first goal of this plan."

 CRM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the defeats in the civil war in 1920, the remnants of the armed forces of the South of Russia retreated to the Crimea, where they were able to securely strengthen themselves due to the geographical position of the peninsula. Over time, the civil war completely subsided and the actual victory in it was won by Red Russia. After that, Crimea staggeringly quickly fell into a severe crisis. Even former allies of Crimea have turned their backs on him, starting to build relations with another Russia. Now Crimea remains a gray area between Ukraine and the USSR, and the current government in the person of Pyotr Wrangel and his supporters does not greatly contribute to changing the political situation on the peninsula."
